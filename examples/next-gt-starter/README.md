# gt-next Starter Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) 

## Getting Started

Install `gt-next`:

```bash
npm i gt-next gt-next-cli
```

Add environment variables in `.env.local`. 
You can get API keys from [generaltranslation.com/dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com).

```bash
GT_API_KEY=""
GT_PROJECT_ID=""
```

Install `gt-next`:

```bash
npm i gt-next gt-next-cli
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If you are using a [development API key](https://generaltranslation.com/docs/usage/apikeys#development-api-key), 
you will be able to see a on-demand temporary preview translation of the page.
