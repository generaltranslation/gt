description: Easily internationalize your React App with gt-react
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [React](https://react.dev) project.

We will cover 4 simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Run the setup wizard
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the GTProvider
  </Step>
  <Step>
    (Optional) Add environment variables
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Clean up strings
  </Step>
</Steps>


---

### 1. Run the setup wizard

The setup wizard will walk you through the process of internationalizing your project.

```bash
npx gtx-cli@latest
```

If you don't want to use the setup wizard, you can follow the [manual setup guide](/docs/react/guides/setup) instead.

The setup wizard will:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Configure your project's supported locales.
3. Wrap your project's JSX components with the `<T>` component.
4. Generate a development API key and project ID for your project.

See the [setup wizard docs](/docs/cli/init) for more information.

### 2. Add the GTProvider

Add the [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) component to your app.
Place it as high up in your React component tree as possible, usually at the root.

Additionally, the setup wizard will create a `gt.config.json` file for you in your project root directory.
Spread this JSON into the `config` prop.

```tsx title="App.tsx" copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";
import config from "./gt.config.json"; // [!code highlight]

export default function App() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <GTProvider {...config}> 
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  For some React frameworks, the setup wizard will automatically add the GTProvider to your app.
  If this is the case, you can skip this step.
</Callout>

### 3. (Optional) Add a Production API Key

The setup wizard will create a `.env.local` file for you in the root of your project containing a development API key and project ID.

This development API key can be used to translate your app in development mode.

However, in order to ship to production, you will need to add a production API key.
Read about the difference between development and production keys [here](/docs/react/concepts/environments).

<Callout>
  The production API key is only required to translate your app in production.
  If you do not plan to ship to production at this time, you can skip this step.
</Callout>

To add a production API key, follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).
            * Navigate to the **API Keys** page in the sidebar.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the Project ID and API Key to your environment variables.
        ```bash
        GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_PRODUCTION_KEY"
        GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    React environment variables are often bundled into your application at build time and are publicly visible in the client-side code.
    For security reasons, you should:
    
    - Only use development API keys during local development
    - Only use production API keys with the CLI tool for deployment
    - **Never include any API keys as environment variables in production**
</Callout>


### 4. Clean up strings

The setup wizard will wrap all of your project's JSX components with the `<T>` component.
However, you may notice that strings are unaffected.

For example, if you have a string constant like this:

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
export default function Example() {
  const greeting = "Hello, world!";
  return <p>{greeting}</p>;
}
```

The setup wizard will not touch this string.

To fix this, you can use the [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) hook to translate the string.

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { useGT } from "gt-react";
export default function Example() {
  const t = useGT();
  return <p>{t("Hello, world!")}</p>;
}
```

Read our [guide on translating strings](/docs/react/guides/strings) for more information.

## Let's try it out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/react/api/components/localeSelector) component to your app.
    This will allow you to select a different language for your app.
    <Callout>
      **Tip:**
      You can also change your language in your browser settings.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your React app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)

    If this does not work, make sure that the list of locales in your [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is up to date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the setup tool automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that will automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, please follow [this guide](/docs/react/guides/strings) for translating strings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some translations inaccurate?">
    The most likely cause of an inaccurate translation is ambiguous wording.
    For example, "apple" can be a fruit or a technology company.

    To fix this, you can provide more context to the translation with the `context` prop.
    The [`<T>`](/docs/react/api/components/t) and [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) functions support a `context` prop.
    For example:
    ```jsx
    <T context="the technology company">Apple</T>
    ```    
    See our [guide on the `<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/jsx) for more information.
  </Accordion>
