title: useLocale()
description: API Reference for the useLocale hook
---

## Overview

The `useLocale` hook retrieves the user's current locale from the [`<GTProvider>` context](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).
The returned locale is [formatted as a string](/docs/reference/locale-strings), e.g., `'en-US'`.

<Callout>
    Ensure your app is wrapped in a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).
</Callout>

## Reference

### Returns

A string representing the user's current locale, e.g., `'en-US'`.

---

## Fallback behavior
When an unsupported locale is requested, a fallback locale will be selected.

For instance, in the event of an unsupported locale,
if (1) the user has configured multiple preferred locales in their browser settings,
and (2) one of these locales are supported by your application,
then the locale will fallback to the best language.

Additionally, if no possible fallback locales are available,
but two locales share the same language (e.g., `en-US` and `en-GB`),
then the locale will fallback to the supported locale that shares the same language.

If neither condition can be met, then the the default locale will be used.

See [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/config/gtprovider) for information on configuring supported locales.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Retrieve the current locale and display it in your component.

```jsx title="CurrentLocale.jsx" copy
import { useLocale } from 'gt-react';

export default function CurrentLocale() {
    const locale = useLocale(); // [!code highlight]
    return <p>Current locale: {locale}</p>;
}
```

## Notes
 * The `useLocale()` hook relies on the [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) to access the context.
   Ensure your app is wrapped with a provider at the root level.
 * Learn more about locale strings [here](/docs/reference/locale-strings).

## Next Steps
 * Learn how to manage and specify supported locales in your application with [locale management](/docs/react/reference/local-management).
 * To access the fallback language, see [`useDefaultLocale()`](/docs/react/api/helpers/useDefaultLocale).
