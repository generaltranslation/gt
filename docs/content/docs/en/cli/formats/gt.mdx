description: Automatically translate your gt-next or gt-react project
---

## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to automatically manage your project's translation files when using [`gt-next`](/docs/next) or [`gt-react`](/docs/react).

<Callout type="warn">
  **Note:**
  This should only be used when you are shipping a production build. If you are using gt-next or gt-react in development, this command is not needed.
</Callout>

We will follow these 4 steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add your environment variables
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Configure your project with the [`npx gtx-cli configure`](/docs/cli/configure) command
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run [`gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate#translate-json)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
  **Tip:**
  Avoid the hassle of using translation files with the [`<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/jsx).
</Callout>

## Step 1: Add your environment variables

Add your production API key and project ID to your environment variables.
This is necessary to use the `gtx-cli` tool.
You get these from the [General Translation dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).

```bash title=".env"
GT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
GT_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
```

## Step 2: Configure your project with the `npx gtx-cli configure` command

Run the `gtx-cli configure` command to configure your project.

```bash
npx gtx-cli configure
```

## Step 3: Add the `gtx-cli translate` command to your build process

Add the `gtx-cli translate` command to your build or CI process before the build command to automatically add translations to your project.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "translate": "npx gtx-cli translate",
    "build": "npm run translate && <your build command>"
  }
}
```
This will generate translations for all of your locales and save them to your project.
If you want to commit these files to your repo, you can instead run this command before committing.


You're done! Now your project will automatically update all of your translation JSON files any time your project changes.

## Notes
 * You can automatically add translations to your project with the [`gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate#translate-json) command.
 * If you want to commit your translation files, you can instead run the `gtx-cli translate` command before committing.
 * To configure the output path for your translations, see the [configuration](/docs/cli/reference/config) docs.

## Next steps
 * See the [usage guide](/docs/cli/reference/usage) for the cli tool.
 * If you want to see live translations in development (think hot reload), check out the [`<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/jsx).
