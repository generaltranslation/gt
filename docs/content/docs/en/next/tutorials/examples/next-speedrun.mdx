title: Speedrun Next.js
description: Let's speedrun creating a new app and internationalizing it with GT.
---

## Overview

In this guide, we'll go over two things:
 - Creating a new Next.js app
 - Internationalizing it with General Translation

In total, this should take less than 10 minutes.


## Prerequisites

We assume that you either have experience using React in some capacity and are familiar with Typescript.

---

## Step 1: Create a new Next.js app

First, navigate to the directory of your choice in terminal and run the following command:

```bash copy
npx create-next-app next-quickstart --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --use-npm --src-dir
```

A set up wizard will appear, you can just select the default value for each option.


## Step 2: Install the libraries

Navigate to your Next.js project's root directory and run:

```bash copy
cd next-quickstart
npm i gt-next
npm i gtx-cli --save-dev
```

## Step 3: Add your environment variables.

Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
Go to the Dev Api Keys page on the nav bar and create a new API key and Project ID.
Then add them to your `.env` file.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

## Step 4: Run the CLI tool

Run the CLI tool to setup your codebase for translation.

```bash copy
npx gtx-cli setup
```

## Step 5: Modify the root layout

Modify the `lang` prop in the `<html>` tag in the `src/app/layout.tsx` file.

It should use `await getLocale()` to get the current locale.

```javascript title="src/app/layout.tsx" copy
import { GTProvider, getLocale } from "gt-next"; // [!code highlight]
...
export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  const locale = await getLocale(); // [!code highlight]
  return (
    <html lang={locale}> // [!code highlight]
      <GTProvider>
        <body
          className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
        >
        {children}
        </body>
      </GTProvider>
    </html>
  );
}
```


## Step 6: Start your app

Your app is internationalized! 🎉
Let's test it!


Let's change your browser's language settings.
 * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424)
 * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
 * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)

Start your Next.js app.
```bash copy
npm run dev
```

Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
If you have set up everything correctly, you should see your app in the language you set in your browser.

## Troubleshooting
<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
        **Browser Cookies**

        Check your browser's cookies for your app.
        General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
        The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
        It will be under `localhost:3000`.
        Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
        refresh the page.

        After this, you won't have to worry about clearing the cookies.

        How to check cookies:
        * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
        * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
        * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
        * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)

## Notes
 * Translate arbitrary jsx with the `<T>` component.
 * If translation is not working when you change your language, check your browser's cookies.

## Next steps
 * Star our GitHub repo [gt-next](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-next).
 * Set up [Right to Left language support](https://generaltranslation.com/docs/next/reference/rtl).
 * Try a more [advanced example](/docs/next/tutorials/examples/currency-converter/setup).
