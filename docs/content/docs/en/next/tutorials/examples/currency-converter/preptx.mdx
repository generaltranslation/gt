title: Add gt-next
description: Let's get your project ready for translation!
---


## Introduction

Congratulations on setting up your NextJS project! Now, let's get it ready for translation using `gt-next`.

Right now your project is a normal, non-internationalized project that can only be read in one language.
However, before we can start translating, we need to add the library to your project and set up your environment.

### Install `gt-next`
Next, let's add the `gt-next` library to your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash copy
npm i gt-next
```

### Set up your environment
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your api key and project id.

```env copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

If you have not set up your project yet, just log in to your [General Translation account](https://wwww.generaltranslation.com/signin).
Open the *DEV* API Keys page and create a new *DEV* API key.
Finally, copy the *DEV* API key and project ID and paste them into your `.env` file.

## Conclusion
By now, everything should be ready and set up to start translating.
All we have to do now is add the `<T>` component to our project and start translating!
