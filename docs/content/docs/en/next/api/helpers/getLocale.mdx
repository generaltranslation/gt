title: getLocale()
description: API Reference for the getLocale server-side method
---

## Overview

The `getLocale()` function retrieves the user's current locale during server-side rendering.
The returned locale is [formatted as a string](/docs/reference/locale-strings), e.g., `'en-US'`.

<Callout>
    `getLocale()` is a server-side method and can only be used on server-side components.
</Callout>

For client-side usage, see [`useLocale()`](/docs/next/api/helpers/useLocale).

## Reference

### Returns

A promise that resolves to a string representing the user's current locale, e.g., `'en-US'`.

---

## Fallback behavior

When an unsupported locale is requested, a fallback locale will be selected.

For instance, in the event of an unsupported locale,
if (1) the user has configured multiple preferred locales in their browser settings,
and (2) one of these locales are supported by your application,
then the locale will fallback to the best language.

Additionally, if no possible fallback locales are available,
but two locales share the same language (e.g., `en-US` and `en-GB`),
then the locale will fallback to the supported locale that shares the same language.

If neither condition can be met, then the the default locale will be used.

See [`gt.config.json`](/docs/next/api/config/gt-config-json) docs for information on configuring supported locales.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Retrieve the user's locale during server-side rendering.

```javascript title="GetUserLocale.jsx" copy
import getLocale from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function GetUserLocale() {
    const locale = await getLocale(); // [!code highlight]
    return <p>User locale: {locale}</p>;
}
```

## Notes
 * The `getLocale()` function is asynchronous and must be awaited to retrieve the locale.
 * It is specifically designed for server-side use. See [`useLocale()`](/docs/next/api/helpers/useLocale) for client-side components.
 * The returned locale adheres to the [locale strings](/docs/reference/locale-strings) format.

## Next Steps
 * Learn how to configure supported locales with [withGTConfig()](/docs/next/api/config/withGTConfig).
 * For managing fallback locales, see [`getDefaultLocale()`](/docs/next/api/helpers/getDefaultLocale).
