description: The gt.config.json file
---

## Overview

The `gt.config.json` file is in charge of storing your project's configuration.
It holds important information like your project's `projectId`, your supported locales, and more.
It also holds important internal information such as your project's `versionId`.


This file is read by (1) your [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withgtconfig) component and (2) the [`gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command.
Because of this, we recommend storing your configuration in your `gt.config.json` file instead of passing it as a prop to your [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withgtconfig) component.

Generally, anything that begins with an underscore (e.g. `_versionId`) is an internal property and should not be modified.
Everything else is fair game.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `projectId` | `string` | Unique identifier for your project in the GT system |
| `locales` | `string[]` | Array of supported locale codes for your project |
| `defaultLocale` | `string` | The primary locale code used as fallback when translations are missing |
| `cacheUrl` | `string` | URL endpoint for caching translation data |
| `runtimeUrl` | `string` | URL endpoint for runtime translation services |
| `stageTranslations` | `boolean` | Configuration for staging/preview translation features |
| `files` | `object` | Path to local translation files for development and testing |
| `_versionId` | `string` | Internal property used to track project version (do not modify) |


### `cacheUrl` and `runtimeUrl`

If you are storing your translations in the cloud, the `cacheUrl` is the base URL for the cache.
The `runtimeUrl` is the base URL for the runtime and only applies to development translations.

### `stageTranslations`

The `stageTranslations` is a flag used by the `gtx-cli` tool to mark your translations as requiring review.
This means that they must be manually approved before they can be deployed to production via the [`gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command.

### `files`

The `files` field specifies a path to locally stored translations (in contrast to storing them in the cloud).
Specifically, the `output` field specifies where the translations will be written to.

```json
{
  "files": {
    "gt": {
      "output": "public/_gt/[locale].json"
    }
  },
}
```



{/* 
### `_versionId`

Points to hit:
- internal
- you can specify your own version names */}

## Examples

### Specifying your locales

```json title="gt.config.json"
{
  "defaultLocale": "en", // Primary locale is English
  "locales": ["fr", "es"] // Secondary locales are French and Spanish
}
```


{/* ### Specifying your own versionId */}

## Notes
 * The `gt.config.json` file is used to specify your project's configuration.
 * It is read by both the [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withgtconfig) component and the [`gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command.
