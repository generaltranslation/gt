## Overview

This guide will show you how to setup your i18n app to support static site generation.

### What is static site generation?

[Static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation) (SSG) is a feature of Next.js that allows you to generate static pages at build time.
This is useful for performance and SEO. 

## SSG for the `app` router

### Requirements

There are a few requirements to enable static site generation for your i18n app.
Depending on whether you are using the `app` or `pages` directory, the requirements are slightly different.

1. Your app must be using the Next.js app router.
2. Your app must support i18n routing (see [i18n routing](/docs/next/guides/middleware))
3. Your app must be using local translations (see [local translations](/docs/next/reference/local-tx))

### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Step 1:**
    First, make sure your app has a `<GTProvider>` component at the root layout.

    ```tsx title="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next';
    ```
    Since the app is using i18n routing, the provider should be placed in the `[locale]/layout.tsx` file.
    
    <Accordions>
      <Accordion title="Why is this required?">
        SSG requires all parameters to be known at build time. This includes the locale for every statically generated page.
        Since the `<GTProvider>` component is responsible for providing the translation context to your app, it must know the locale.

        For the same reason, your app must be using i18n routing (since each route must correspond to a specific locale, for a specific page).
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Step 2:**
    Next, make sure your app is using the `loadTranslations` function to load translations.
    Additionally, pass in the locale as a parameter to the `<GTProvider>`. You can obtain the locale from the `params` object.

    ```tsx title="app/[locale]/layout.tsx"
    import { loadTranslations } from '@/i18n/loadTranslations';
    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next';

    export default async function RootLayout({
      children,
      params,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode;
      params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;
    }) {
      const { locale } = await params;
      return (
        <GTProvider loadTranslations={loadTranslations} locale={locale}>
          {children}
        </GTProvider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Step 3:**
    Then, make sure all of your hooks and components are importing from `gt-next/client`.

    ```tsx
    import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';
    import { T } from 'gt-next/client';
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      This is important because hooks and components imported from `gt-next/client` never read headers, which don't exist at build time for statically generated pages.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Make sure you have configured your Next.js app to use the [`getStaticParams` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) correctly!

That's it! Your app should now support static site generation for multiple languages!

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My pages aren't being statically generated!">
    If you've followed the steps above and your pages are still not being statically generated, double check that all of your hooks and components are importing from `gt-next/client`.

    As a rule of thumb, anything that reads headers or cookies will prevent SSG. This means you can't use any of the following:
    - `await getGT()`
    - `await getLocale()`
    - `await getDict()`
    - `import { T } from 'gt-next'`
    
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
