## Overview

This guide will walk you through how to setup your React project with `gt-react`.

By the end of this guide, you will have a React app that is ready to start translating content.

This is more in-depth and manual than the [Quickstart](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart) guide, and is recommended for those who want to understand the different concepts and options available to them.

In this guide, we will cover the following:

### Prerequisites

- A React project using a supported framework (Next.js, Vite, etc.)

## Installation

Install the `gt-react` and `gtx-cli` packages:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i --save-dev gtx-cli
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add --save-dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

### `GTProvider`

The core of `gt-react` is the `GTProvider` component.

It is responsible for:

- Managing the user's current locale
- Providing relevant translations to your application
- Providing context to hooks for accessing translations
- Providing context to hooks for changing the user's locale

<Steps>
  <Step>
    First, add the `GTProvider` component to your application. It should be placed as high up in your component tree as possible.

    ```tsx copy title="src/App.tsx"
    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <GTProvider>
          <App />
        </GTProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Next, create a [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file in the root of your project.
    This file is used to configure both the `gtx-cli` tool and the `gt-react` library.

    ```json
    {
      "defaultLocale": "en",
      "locales": ["fr", "es"]
    }
    ```
    You should customize the `defaultLocale` and `locales` to match your project. See the list of [supported locales](/docs/platform/locale-strings) for more information.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Lastly, spread the `gt.config.json` file into the provider's props.

    ```tsx
    import gtConfig from './gt.config.json';

    <GTProvider {...gtConfig}>
      <App />
    </GTProvider>
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      Spreading the `gt.config.json` file makes the config consistent across your application and CLI tool.

      Alternatively, you can individually specify each prop in the `GTProvider` component.

      ```tsx
      <GTProvider
        defaultLocale="en"
        locales={["fr", "es"]}
      >
      ```
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

<Tabs items={["Vite", "Next.js Pages Router", "Gatsby", "RedwoodJS",  "create-react-app", "Other"]}>
    <Tab value="Vite">
    ```bash copy
    VITE_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Gatsby">
    ```bash copy
    GATSBY_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    GATSBY_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="RedwoodJS">
    ```bash copy
    REDWOOD_ENV_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    REDWOOD_ENV_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Next.js Pages Router">
    ```bash copy
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="create-react-app">
    ```bash copy
    REACT_APP_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    REACT_APP_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Other">
    Many react frameworks each have a unique way of exporting environment variables to the client.
    In development environments, both `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` need to be exported to the client.

    We have added support for a few libraries so far,
    but please let us know if your framework is not listed by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generaltranslation/gt/issues/new).
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Make sure your API key variable is only set in your development environment! It should not be set in production.**
</Callout>

You can get a free API key and project ID by creating a [General Translation account](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/signup).

After creating an account, navigate to the [Development API Keys](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/settings/dev-api-keys) page to get your Dev API key and project ID.

Alternatively, you can also use the CLI tool command `npx gtx-cli auth` to generate an API key and project ID for your project, saved to your `.env.local` file.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to use the General Translation platform?">
  `gt-react` is an i18n library that can work standalone without any environment variables.
  Without them, the library will act very similarly to other i18n libraries, and will still have core internationalization functionality.

  However, `gt-react` also offers a native integration with the General Translation platform.
  This integration unlocks additional functionality in the library, such as:

  - Translation Hot Reloading in Development
  - Automatic AI translations
  - Syncing translations with the General Translation platform
  - Native integration with our translation CDN

  To avoid using the General Translation platform, just don't set any environment variables.

## Usage

Great! If you've followed the steps above, your React project is now setup to use `gt-react`.

The next step is to internationalize your content. 
Here, we'll give a brief overview of the different ways to translate content in your application.

For more detailed guides on each of these, see the other guides in this section.

### `<T>` Component

The `<T>` component is the main component for translating JSX content in your application.

To use it, simply wrap the JSX you want to translate in the `<T>` component.

```tsx
import { T } from 'gt-react';
<T>
  <div>Your content</div>
</T>
```

### `useGT` Hook

The `useGT` hook is a React hook that returns a function that can be used to translate strings.

```tsx
import { useGT } from 'gt-react';

const translate = useGT();
translate('Hello, world!');
```


<Callout type="info">
  Utilizing the hot-reload translation functionality will be helpful for internationalizing your application.

  To enable this, make sure you have the `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` environment variables set in your development environment.
</Callout>

## Deployment

After you've setup your project and internationalized some content, here's how to deploy your application.

The behavior of `gt-react` in production is slightly different from development. Specifically, no translations will be performed at runtime.

This means that you'll need to translate your content before deploying your application, in the build process.

Luckily, the `gtx-cli` tool has a `translate` command that can be used to automatically translate your content.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    First, you'll need to get a Production API key from the [General Translation platform](https://dash.generaltranslation.com).

    Please note that this key is different from your Development API key, and begins with `gtx-api-`, instead of `gtx-dev-`.

    Read about the difference between Development and Production keys [here](/docs/react/concepts/environments).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add this environment variable to your CI/CD pipeline.

    ```bash
    GT_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
    GT_API_KEY=<your-production-api-key>
    ```
    <Callout type='warn'>
      Make sure that `GT_API_KEY` is **NOT** prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or `VITE_`, depending on your framework!

      If it is, you'll risk exposing your API key to the public.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the `translate` command to translate your content.

    ```bash
    npx gtx-cli translate
    ```
    You can configure the behavior of the `translate` command with the [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file.

    See the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide for more information.
    
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the `translate` command to your build process.

    ```json title="package.json" copy
    {
      "scripts": {
        "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <...YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND...>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not using the General Translation platform?">
    If you're not using the General Translation platform, you can still use `gt-react` in production.

    However, you'll need to manually translate your content before deploying your application.

    Instead of running `translate`, run the `generate` command to generate JSON files containing all of your translation data (in your source language).

    ```bash
    npx gtx-cli generate
    ```

    Then, you'll need to manually edit / translate these files, and load them into your application with [`loadTranslations`](/docs/react/guides/local-tx).
