## How to use the `<T>` component

Let's say you have some HTML content that you want to translate. 

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <p>Hello, world!</p>;
}
```

All you have to do is wrap the content in a `<T>` component.

```jsx
import { T } from 'gt-react';

function Greeting() {
  return <T><p>Hello, world!</p></T>;
}
```

Depending on the current language your user has selected, this will render the appropriate translation. 
See [switching languages](/docs/react/guides/languages) for more information on how to allow your users to switch languages.

---

## Additional Options

### Context

In some cases, you may want to provide additional context to the translation.
This can be done by passing a `context` prop to the `<T>` component.

```jsx
<T context="toast, as in a pop-up notification">
  Click on the toast to dismiss it.
</T>
```

This is useful in cases where words may have multiple meanings depending on the context.
For example, "toast" can refer to the food or a pop-up notification.

The context prop is helpful for the AI to understand the intent of the translation.

### `id`

You can also pass an `id` prop to the `<T>` component.
This is useful for debugging purposes and makes editing the translation easier.

```jsx
<T id="toast">
  Click on the toast to dismiss it.
</T>
```

## When to use the `<T>` component

While the `<T>` component is very flexible, it is not always the best solution.

You should always try to use the `<T>` component when you have any **static HTML or JSX content.**

### When not to use the `<T>` component

**DO NOT** use the `<T>` component when you have any unsafe **dynamic** content.

Here, dynamic content means any content that could change at runtime. 
This rule does not apply if you are using [Variable Components](/docs/react/guides/variables) or [Branching Components](/docs/react/guides/branches).

<Callout>
  **Note:**
  
  Variable components are a special case where the content is dynamic, but the content has been wrapped and sanitized, so it is safe to use the `<T>` component.

  Content wrapped in variable components are never translated directly by the `<T>` component.
</Callout>


The following examples show invalid usage of the `<T>` component:

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Your username is {username}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Current date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Logical Expressions: {username === 'admin' ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
</T>
```

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Conditional Rendering: {isAdmin ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
</T>
```

<Callout>
  In the above examples, the content can be safely internationalized using [variable components](/docs/react/guides/variables) and [branching components](/docs/react/guides/branches).
</Callout>

```jsx
const chatMessage = getChatMessageFromServer();
<T>
  <p>{chatMessage}</p>
</T>
```

<Callout>
  In this example, the content is fully dynamic, so it should be translated on the server side before being passed to the client.

  See the [core](/docs/core) library for more information on how to dynamically translate content via our API.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `<T>` component. These are all correct.

1. HTML content
<Tabs items={['Result', 'Original']}>
  <Tab value="Result">
```jsx
<T>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</T>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Original">
    ```jsx
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Simple JSX content
<Tabs items={['Result', 'Original']}>
  <Tab value="Result">
```jsx
<T>
  <Button>Click me!</Button>
</T>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Original">
    ```jsx
    <Button>Click me!</Button>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

3. Complex JSX content
<Tabs items={['Result', 'Original']}>
  <Tab value="Result">
```jsx
<T>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-destructive px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-destructive-foreground">
        <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
        <span>Free Usage</span>
      </div>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>
      <p>
        You are nearing your free monthly limit. Please
        upgrade your plan to avoid any disruptions to your
        service.
      </p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</T>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Original">
    ```jsx
    <Tooltip>
      <TooltipTrigger>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-destructive px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-destructive-foreground">
          <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
          <span>Free Usage</span>
        </div>
      </TooltipTrigger>
      <TooltipContent>
        <p>
          You are nearing your free monthly limit. Please
          upgrade your plan to avoid any disruptions to your
          service.
        </p>
      </TooltipContent>
    </Tooltip>
    ```
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>






<Callout>
  The `<T>` component can handle any nested content in the same component.
</Callout>

## Production Considerations [#production]


### Deploying to production

Make sure to run the translate command before deploying to production, so that all translations are available at runtime.
We recommend adding it to your CD pipeline or as a part of your build script.
```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>",
  }
}
```

For a more detailed guide on deploying your application, please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy) tutorial.
For more information on the command, please refer to the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide.

### Behavior: Development vs Production

In development, the `<T>` component will translate content on-demand.
This means that when the component is rendered, it will perform a translation immediately.
The library does this for convenience to make development with other languages easier.

To enable this behavior, just add a Dev API key to your environment.

In production, all translations that the `<T>` component uses are completed at build time.
This means that you have to run the translation command before deploying your application.

<Callout>
  **Tip:**
  If you want to simulate production behavior in development, just use a production API key in your development build.
</Callout>

### Privacy Concerns

With some exceptions, all content wrapped in a `<T>` component is sent to the General Translation API for translation.
This might not be desirable for rendering sensitive data, such as usernames, account numbers, etc.

To circumvent this issue, use [Variable Components](/docs/react/guides/variables#privacy) to handle private information.
This ensures that no sensitive data is sent to the General Translation API for translation.
Localization of any content wrapped in a variable component is handled locally.

## Common Pitfalls


### Direct descendants only [#direct-text]

The `<T>` component only translates text passed directly as a child.
This means that if you have content inside a component that is not directly passed to `<T>`, it will not be translated.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```jsx copy
function UntranslatedContent() {
  return (
    <p>This content is not translated</p>
  );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <T>
      <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      <UntranslatedContent />
    </T>
  );
}
```

In this example, the content inside `<UntranslatedContent>` will not be translated.
Only the content directly inside `<T>` will be translated, like the `<h1>` tag and its children.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why does this happen?">
    This occurs because of how React renders components.
    It is a bit complicated, but the gist is that React does not know the content of a component until it has rendered.
    Therefore, the contents of components like `<UntranslatedContent>` are not translated.
    However, any text directly between the two `<T>` tags will be translated.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
<Callout>
  **Note:** A good rule of thumb is that any content that is *literally* between the two `<T>` tags in the file will be translated.
  You can always add another `<T>` to translate the content that is not being translated, though nesting `<T>` components is not recommended.
</Callout>

#### What's the fix?

Wrap the text in the `<T>` component directly, like so:

```jsx copy
function TranslatedContent() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>This content <b>IS</b> translated</p>
    </T>
  );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <>
      <T>
        <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      </T>
      <TranslatedContent />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Nested `<T>` Components [#nested-t]

Nesting `<T>` components is not allowed.
Because of React's rendering system, this can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.

Here is an example of **what not to do**:

```jsx copy
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <T>
      Hello, friend!
    </T>
  );
}

export default function NestedTranslation() {
  return (
    <T>
      <T> {/* Don't do this! */} 
        Hello, world! 
      </T>
      <SomeComponent /> {/* This still counts. Don't do this! */}
    </T>
  );
}
```

The solution here is to remove the outtermost `<T>` component.

## Summary
 * `<T>` components are used to internationalize arbitrary JSX Content.
 * `<T>` components should not be used for dynamic content, without using variable components or branching components.
 * In development, the `<T>` component will translate content on-demand.
 * In production, all translations that the `<T>` component uses are completed at build time.

## Next Steps
 * Read about the [API](/docs/react/api/components/t) for the `<T>` component.
