title: Standalone i18n
description: How to use gt-next as a standalone i18n library
---

## Overview

`gt-next` has feature parity with many other i18n libraries.
This means that you can use `gt-next` as a standalone i18n library, without using the General Translation platform.

To do this, simply don't provide any environment variables such as `GT_API_KEY` or `GT_PROJECT_ID`.

See our [migration guide](/docs/next/guides/migration) for more information on how to migrate from another i18n library to `gt-next`.

## Tradeoffs

Using `gt-next` as a standalone i18n library has some tradeoffs.

### Manual translation

You will need to manually translate your app. If you use our platform, we automatically translate your app for you.

If your project only uses [dictionaries](/docs/next/guides/dictionaries) with the `useDict()` and `getDict()` functions,
you'll need to manually translate your dictionaries, as you would with any other i18n library.

Make sure you load your translated dictionaries with the [`loadDictionary()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-dictionary) function.

If your project is using inline translations with the [`<T>`](/docs/next/guides/jsx) component
or the [`useGT() & getGT()`](/docs/next/guides/strings) functions,
you'll also need to manually translate your strings.

Since there are no keys with in-line translations, the CLI tool has a command: [`gtx-cli generate`](/docs/cli/generate)
which will automatically generate template files for your project. You'll just need to edit the template files with your translations for each language.

Make sure you load your translated strings with the [`loadTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations) function.

### No development translations

Without an API key, translation hot-reload will not work. Untranslated content will only be rendered in your default language.
