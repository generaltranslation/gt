All of our features are free to use.

There are 3 ways to use General Translation:

1. Free Tier: Use our open-source libraries with our free AI-powered translation service.
2. Paid Tier: Use our open-source libraries with our paid translation service.
3. Fully standalone: Use our open-source libraries with your own translation provider.

## Free Tier

General Translation offers a generous free tier for our AI-powered translation service.

This free tier is rate-limited on a per-organization basis to:

- 20,000 production tokens per month.
- 30,000 development tokens per month.

This tier is intended for personal use on small solo projects.

## Paid Tiers

If you're working on a larger project and need more tokens, you can upgrade to a paid plan.

Our paid plans are pay-as-you-go, with an included quota of tokens every billing cycle.

We currently offer 2 paid plans:

- **Pro**
- **Enterprise**


### Pro

The Pro plan includes $30 worth of tokens every month (paid monthly), or $360 worth of tokens every year (paid yearly).

Our token rates are priced at:

- $0.0005 per token translated in production.
- $0.0001 per token translated in development.

The type of API key used determines the type of token you'll be billed for. 
See the [API keys](/docs/platform/apikeys) page for more information on the different types of API keys.

We use the [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to calculate tokens from a text corpus.

### Enterprise

Please [contact us](https://generaltranslation.com/contact) for more information on the Enterprise plan.


## Fully standalone

If you like the features offered by the General Translation libraries, such as `<T>` components and `useGT()` functions,
but don't want to use our translation service, you can use our libraries with your own translation provider.

This will require more manual work, but you will have full control over your translations.

See the [open-source docs](/docs/platform/open-source) for more information.
