description: How to review translations on the General Translation platform

<Callout>
  This feature is currently only supported for apps using `gt-next` or `gt-react`.
</Callout>

## Overview

After you've translated your project with General Translation, you can review your translations on the General Translation platform
before they go live.

This feature is useful for:

- Catching any issues with your translations before they go live.
- Compliance with your organization's internal content policies.
- Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

## How to use

This feature is currently only available to organizations with a paid plan.

To enable human review, you need to:

1. Go to the [project settings page](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/settings/project).
2. Toggle the "Human Review" switch.

In your CI pipeline, instead of running `gtx-cli translate`, run [`gtx-cli stage`](/docs/cli/commands/stage)
to stage your translations for review. Then, when you're ready to deploy your app in CD, run `gtx-cli translate`

<Callout>
  Think of `stage` as `git add + git commit` for translations, while `translate` is `git push`.

  `stage` simply stages your translations for review, while `translate` completes the process 
  and downloads the translations (if configured to do so).

  `stage` must always be ran before `translate`, just like how `git add & commit` must always be ran before `git push`.

## How to review translations

1. Go to the [project review page](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/project/review).
2. Select the language you want to review.
3. Go through each translation for that language and approve it.
If you're not happy with a translation, you can edit it or request a new translation.
4. Or, click the "Approve All" button to approve all translations for the language.

<Callout>
  Until all translations for a language are approved, the CLI tool will hang (when running `gtx-cli translate`),
  and no translations will be published to the CDN.

  When all translations for a language are approved, the translation will automatically be published to the CDN (if enabled).
