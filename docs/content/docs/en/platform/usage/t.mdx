description: How to use the <T> component

## Overview

The `<T>` component is the primary way to translate content in General Translation.
It can be used alongside dictionaries, or standalone.

The `<T>` component can be used to translate text, HTML, and JSX.

All you need to do is wrap your text in the `<T>` component, and it will be translated.

No additional configuration is required!

```jsx
import { T } from 'gt-react'; // [!code highlight]

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <h1>List of Shakespeare Plays: </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Hamlet</li>
        <li>A Midsummer Night's Dream</li>
        <li>Macbeth</li>
      </ul>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```


### Our Advice

We recommend using the `<T>` component because of its simplicity especially if you are new to internationalization (i18n).
We offer [dictionaries](/docs/next/guides/dictionaries) for those who prefer this design pattern from past experiences or ease of integration with existing code bases.
