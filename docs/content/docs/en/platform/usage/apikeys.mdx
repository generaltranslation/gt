description: How to use API keys with General Translation
---

## Overview

There are two types of API keys used with General Translation:

- **Production API Key**: This is used to translate your content in production.
- **Development API Key**: This is used to translate your content in development.

The behavior between the two types of keys are different, so you should be careful to use the correct key for the environment you are in.

```bash
GT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GT_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

If you are using `gt-next` or `gt-react` as a standalone i18n library, you do not need to use API keys.

## Behavior

Most simply put, Prod API keys persist translations, while Dev API keys do not.
You use Dev API keys for prototyping translations and Prod API keys when you are ready to deploy.

### Development API Key

This type of key is useful for testing and development purposes.
When using a development API key, translations are done on-demand and memoized in memory. 
Translations **will not be saved**.

The development API key is used by components rendered in the browser (client-side) and by server-side rendered components to facilitate on-demand translation.
This means that it must be exported to the client.
This key should NEVER be used in production environments and NEVER should be passed to the client in a production environment.

```bash
# example Vite .env file for dev
VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_GT_API_KEY=your-dev-api-key # Only used in development
```

<Callout type="warn">
  **Warning:**
  Development API keys are passed to the client to facilitate client-side translation in development. 
  This is fine in development environments, but is a security risk in production environments.
  If your application is open to the internet, you should never use a development API key.
</Callout>

### Production API Key

When using a production API key, translations **are persisted**.
This means that translations will be saved (either in a CDN or in your app's bundle) to be used at runtime.

This key is used in two places:
 * The [`gtx-cli`](/docs/cli) tool. Check out the [docs](/docs/cli) for more information.
 * The `gt-next` library when translations occur at runtime in a production build (server-side only, not used by `gt-react`).
    * [`<Tx>`](/docs/next/api/components/tx) and [`tx()`](/docs/next/api/strings/tx) functions are used to translate content at runtime.

The API key is only used by the server, and it should NEVER be exported to the client.
```bash
GT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GT_API_KEY=your-prod-api-key # This key should never be exported to the client
```

## Notes
 * Development API keys are used for testing and development purposes. It should only be used in development.
 * Production API keys are used for production purposes.

## Next steps
 * Check out how to use [the `<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/jsx) to see live translations in development.
 * See the [usage guide](/docs/cli/reference/usage) for the cli tool.
