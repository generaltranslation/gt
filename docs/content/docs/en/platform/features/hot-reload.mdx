  <Accordion title="How is this more useful than Google Translate?">
    Google Translate translates text nodes in the HTML DOM on a page-by-page basis.
    This means that formatting and layout are easily lost in translation, and can vary highly from one page to the next.

    On the other hand, General Translation modifies your React code directly, so what you see is exactly what your users will see.
