## Overview

Inline translations let you write and translate your content directly in your code

**No separate dictionary or translation files required.**

This makes it easy to keep your UI and translations in sync, and is perfect for projects where content changes frequently or is tightly coupled to your components.
 


## Why Use Inline Translations?

- **Simplicity:** No need to manage external translation files.
- **Complexity:** Content and code live together, reducing context switching.
- **Instant updates:** Changes to text are immediately reflected in all languages.
- **Maintainability:** No need to worry about keeping your translations up to date or deleting unused translations.

Whether you have text, HTML, or JSX, everything can be translated.
No additional configuration necessary!

```jsx
import { T } from 'gt-react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <h1>List of Shakespeare Plays: </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Hamlet</li>
        <li>A Midsummer Night's Dream</li>
        <li>Macbeth</li>
      </ul>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```
