## What is General Translation?

General Translation is an entire internationalization (i18n) stack that allows you to ship multilingual apps quickly and easily.

![Live translations in action](/live_translations.gif)

General Translation includes the following:

- Open-source developer libraries for React and Next.js
- An AI translation service
- A complete infrastructure package for serving translation content

If you would like to use GT libraries with your own translation provider, please see our standalone docs for [gt-next](/docs/next/concepts/stand-alone) and [gt-react](/docs/react/concepts/stand-alone).

If you would like to use your own i18n library, but still want to use General Translation's AI translation service, please see our [CLI tool](/docs/cli) docs.

If you would like to use General Translation to translate your JSON, Markdown, or MDX files, please see our [CLI tool](/docs/cli) docs.

```bash
npx gtx-cli@latest init
```
Run our setup wizard to get started!

## Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è Translate entire React components in-line
- A single opening and closing `<T>` component is all you need to translate an entire React component.
  - No need for complex refactoring or messy function calls.
- Content is in-line and in the same location as your code.
  - No keys, strings, or additional files are needed!
- The library manages all i18n logic behind the scenes, so you don't have to.
- Translations are always kept in sync with your source code.
- Translations contain contextual information about the content, so they are more accurate.

```jsx title="Page.jsx" copy
export default function Page() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {"<T>"} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href="/">link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

### üîé Feature parity with existing libraries
- GT libraries also support the same features as existing libraries like `i18next`, `react-intl`, and `next-intl`.
- Features such as dictionaries, plurals, currencies, and automatic routing are all supported.

### üß† Free AI-powered translation service
- Our free AI-powered translation service allows you to create translations for your app in seconds.
- **Translation hot reload** will automatically update your translations as you write them.
- HTML content is re-arranged and customized according to the language.

### üîß Developer-friendly
- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes.
- All GT libraries are open-source and work standalone.
  - You can use your own translation provider or use our free AI-powered translation service.
- No more wasting time managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!

See our [Github repo](https://github.com/generaltranslation/gt) for the source code and some example projects.

## Why choose General Translation?

**General Translation is an entire i18n stack**, including developer libraries, AI translations, and a complete infrastructure package for multilingual apps.

You can mix and match our libraries with your own translation provider, or use our free AI-powered translation service with your own i18n library.

For a seamless, end-to-end i18n experience, we recommend using our libraries with our translation service.

With GT libraries like `gt-react` and `gt-next`, you can:

### 1. Translate entire React components, not just strings

UI passed as the children of the `<T>` component will be translated regardless of how complicated the JSX tree is. For example:

```javascript title="page.jsx"
import { T } from "gt-next";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>Any children of <b>the {`<T>`} component</b> will be translated.</p>
      <p>
        Things like <a href="/">links</a>{', '}
        <button>buttons</button>{', '}
        and even <div> <div> <div> deeply nested components </div> </div> </div>  are translated.
      </p>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

### 2. Translate both client and server components

With first class support for the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and
[React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components),
you can translate both client and server components.

```jsx title="src/components/MyServerComponent.jsx" copy
import getName from "@/getName";
import { T, Var } from "gt-next";

export default async function MyServerComponent() {
  const name = await getName();

  return (
    <T>
      {/* [!code highlight] */}
      Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>
    </T>
  );
}
```

```jsx title="src/components/MyClientComponent.jsx" copy
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { T, Var } from "gt-next";

export default function MyClientComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Alice");

  return (
    <T>
      {/* [!code highlight] */}
      Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>
    </T>
  );
}
```

### 3. Write content inline or in dictionaries

JSX content placed inside a `<T>` component is marked for translation:

```jsx title="Page.jsx" copy
import { T } from "gt-next";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      {/* [!code highlight] */}
      <p>Hello, World!</p>  {/* translates <p>Hello, World!</p> */}
    </T>
  )
}
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using the historic dictionary approach, you can write your content in a dictionary file:
<Tabs items={['.json', '.js', '.ts']}>
  <Tab value=".json">
  ```json title="dictionary.json" copy
  {
    "greeting": "Hello, World!"
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value=".js">
  ```js title="dictionary.js" copy
  const dictionary = {
    greeting: "Hello, World!"
  }
  export default dictionary;
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value=".ts">
  ```ts title="dictionary.ts" copy
  const dictionary = {
    greeting: "Hello, World!" 
  }
  export default dictionary;
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```jsx title="page.jsx" copy
import { useDict } from "gt-next";

export default function Page() {
  const d = useDict();
  return d('greeting'); // translates "Hello, World!" // [!code highlight]
}
```

### 4. View translated content in development

No need to worry about how UI looks in different languages,
**General Translation will automatically translate your content as you write it in real-time.**

Instead of having to continuously revise your UI multiple times in production,
simply write your content in English **once** and let General Translation handle the rest.

Need to see how your UI elements look in German before deploying? No problem, General Translation will automatically translate them for you!

### 5. Translate content on-demand

Apps often need to translate content only known at runtime.
For Next.js, GT libraries support the ability to translate content on demand.

Some common examples include:
 - User-specific information
 - Remotely stored content
 - Content that is generated dynamically

Once the translation is loaded, it will rewrite your component in real time with the new translation content.
