description: General Translation libraries are open source!

## Overview

All of our libraries are open source and free to use. They work fully standalone, out of the box.

You can use them in any project, without needing to ever create an account or sign up for General Translation services.

Standalone, our libraries support the following features:

- Wrapping entire React components for translation
- Dictionaries
- Easy project setup
- Middleware

Using General Translation as a translation provider will unlock the following features:

- On-demand translation
- Automatic AI translations
- A no-hassle translation CDN

## How to use

To use `gt-next` or `gt-react` with your own translation provider, use local translations:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Next.js"
    href="/docs/next/guides/local-tx"
  />
  <Card
    title="React"
    href="/docs/react/guides/local-tx"
  />
</Cards>

## Managing translations

To generate the translation files for your project, run the CLI tool with the following command:

```bash
npx gtx-cli configure # Configure your project
npx gtx-cli generate # Generate the translation files
```

This command will generate the JSON data files for your project's source code. 
You can then use these files with your own translation provider.
To load the translations into `gt-next` or `gt-react`, use the `loadTranslations` function, as specified in
the local translations guide.

See the [CLI API reference](/docs/cli/generate) for more information.
