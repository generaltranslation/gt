**Locadex is an AI agent built to handle 100% of internationalization (i18n) and translation work for you.**

It takes 5 minutes to install, after which your Mintlify docs will be configured and translated into all the languages you choose automatically.

Locadex:
* Sets up i18n routing and redirects in your docs
* Translates markdown files, code blocks, and snippets in context
* Continuously translates as you push new content

### Step 1: Sign into the General Translation Dashboard

Review the PR and merge it to complete your i18n setup.

### Step 8: Continuous internationalization

After the initial setup PR is merged, Locadex monitors your main branch for commits and updates translations as needed.
