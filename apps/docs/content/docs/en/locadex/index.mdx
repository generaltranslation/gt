```bash

```

Translating your Next.js app into French, Spanish, Japanese, or any other language is painful and time-consuming.

**Locadex is an AI agent** built to handle 100% of the internationalization (i18n) work for you.

This includes:
* Configuring your project to use the gt-next i18n library
* Modifying your React components and strings to support multilingual content
* Translating your app into as many languages as you need

Install it via the [dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/locadex).

## Supported frameworks

Currently, Locadex only supports Next.js App router apps.
