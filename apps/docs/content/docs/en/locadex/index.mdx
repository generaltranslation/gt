## Overview

**Locadex** is an AI agent that automates the process of internationalizing your project.

It can be installed as a CLI tool or configured as a Github Action.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure API Keys

Before running Locadex, you need to configure your API keys. You can set them as environment variables in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>"
export GT_API_KEY="<your-gt-api-key>"
export GT_PROJECT_ID="<your-gt-project-id>"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```bash title=".env"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>"
GT_API_KEY="<your-gt-api-key>"
GT_PROJECT_ID="<your-gt-project-id>"
```

### 2. Run Locadex CLI Tool

The easiest way to get started is to run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npx locadex start
```

This single command will handle everything for you:

- Automatically install `locadex` if it's not already in your project.
- Automatically configure your project to use `gt-next`.
- Automatically add the [`translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command to your build script.
- Automatically internationalize your project.

### 3. Run Locadex as a Github Action

Locadex can also be configured as a Github Action.

This is useful for continuous i18n of your project.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/locadex.yml" copy
name: Run Locadex

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  locadex:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Locadex
        uses: generaltranslation/locadex@v0.1.1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Feel free to customize the workflow to your needs.


Every time this workflow triggers, Locadex will automatically internationalize any changes you've made to your project
and create a pull request with the changes.

<Callout type="info">
  The Github Action assumes you have already ran `npx locadex start` in your project or have manually configured your project to use `gt-next`.
