```bash
npx locadex start
```

Translating your Next.js app into French, Spanish, Japanese, or any other language is painful and time-consuming.

**Locadex is an open-source, Claude-powered agent** built to handle 100% of the internationalization (i18n) work for you.

This includes:
* Configuring your project to use the gt-next i18n library
* Modifying your React components and strings to support multilingual content
* Translating your app into as many languages as you need

It can be installed as a CLI tool or configured as a [Github Action](/docs/locadex/github-action).

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure API Keys

Before running Locadex, you need to configure your API keys. You can set them as environment variables in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<Your Anthropic API Key>"
export GT_API_KEY="<Your GT Production API Key>"
export GT_PROJECT_ID="<Your GT Project ID>"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```bash title=".env"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<Your Anthropic API Key>"
GT_API_KEY="<Your GT Production API Key>"
GT_PROJECT_ID="<Your GT Project ID>"
```

You can get API keys from the [dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com).

### 2. Run Locadex CLI

The easiest way to get started is to run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npx locadex start
```

This single command:

- Installs `locadex` and `gt-next`
- Fully internationalizes every file in your project
- Adds the [`translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command to your build script
- Adds the [locadex Github Action](/docs/locadex/github-action) to your project's CI workflow
- Fully translates your project with production-quality translations (if you provide a GT API key)

<Callout type="info">
  Depending on the size of your project, this agent may take some time to complete. We recommend running it in a keep-alive terminal session. 
</Callout>

### 3. Continuous internationalization

Locadex can also be configured as a Github action for continuous internationalization. 
Your app will automatically be internationalized every time you push a change to your repository.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure that your project is already prepared for i18n with the gt-next library! The easiest way to do this is to run `npx locadex start` in your project first!
</Callout>

Add the following to a `.github/workflows/locadex.yml` file:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/locadex.yml" copy
name: Run Locadex

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  locadex:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Locadex
        uses: generaltranslation/locadex@v0
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          gt_api_key: ${{ secrets.GT_API_KEY }}
          gt_project_id: ${{ secrets.GT_PROJECT_ID }}
```

Every time this workflow triggers, Locadex will automatically internationalize any changes you've made to your project
and create a pull request with the changes.

Feel free to customize this workflow to your needs.
