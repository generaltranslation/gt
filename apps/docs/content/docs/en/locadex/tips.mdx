## Overview

Locadex is a powerful agent that can be used to internationalize your project.

Here are some tips and tricks for using Locadex.

## Monorepo

To use Locadex with a monorepo, simply specify your app directory on the dashboard in the Locadex settings.

## Customizing locales

By default, Locadex will install in your project with the locales you specify during the setup process.

However, you can later customize these locales by editing the `gt.config.json` file in your codebase.

Refer to the [gt.config.json](/docs/cli/reference/config) documentation for more information.
