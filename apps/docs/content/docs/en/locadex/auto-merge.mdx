title: Auto-merge Pull Requests
description: Configure Locadex to automatically merge pull requests
---
Auto-merge eliminates manual PR review for Locadex-generated pull requests. When enabled, PRs created by Locadex merge automatically without requiring your approval.

This applies to all PRs Locadex creates, including:
- Continuous i18n
- Update Locales
- Translation redeployments

*This does not apply to Setup or Re-run Setup PRs.*

For Mintlify projects, auto-merge is enabled by default.

## Enable auto-merge

Navigate to the Locadex page in your dashboard and toggle auto-merge under "Run Configuration":

**Make sure to click "Save" after toggling auto-merge** to apply your changes.

**Note**: The Auto-merge toggle only appears when "Locadex Action" is set to "Create pull request".

## Bypass branch protection rules

If your default branch has protection rules, Locadex will continue creating PRs but cannot merge them automatically. Configure Locadex to bypass branch protection:

### Step 1: Open repository rulesets

In your GitHub repository settings, select "Rulesets" from the Rules section.

### Step 2: Identify blocking rules

Find rules preventing automatic merges. Common blockers include:

- "Require a pull request before merging"
- Required status checks
- Required review approvals

**Note**: Multiple rules may need updating.

### Step 3: Add bypass permissions

Click the rule blocking auto-merge, then:

1. Click "Add Bypass"
2. Select "Locadex Agent" from the dropdown

### Step 4: Save changes

Click "Save" at the bottom of the page to apply your changes.

**Make sure to click "Save"** â€” this step is easy to miss.

Locadex will now automatically merge PRs it creates on your default branch.
