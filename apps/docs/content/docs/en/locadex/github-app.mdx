## Setup Process

### Step 1: Sign into Your Account

Go to your [General Translation dashboard](https://dash.generaltranslation.com) and sign in to your account. Only Pro and Enterprise users can use the GitHub app.

### Step 2: Connect GitHub

1. Navigate to the GitHub integration section in your dashboard
2. Click "Connect GitHub" to link your GitHub account
3. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection

### Step 3: Install the GitHub App

1. After connecting GitHub, you'll be redirected to install the Locadex GitHub app
2. Choose which repositories to give Locadex access to:
   - Install on all repositories, or
   - Select specific repositories
3. Click "Install" to complete the GitHub app installation

### Step 4: Link Repository to Project

1. Back in your GT dashboard, select the repository you want to internationalize
2. This connects your repo to your translation settings and target languages
3. Only one repository can be linked to a project, but you can create multiple projects, each with a different repository

### Step 5: Configure Settings

On the configuration screen, set up:

- **Target Languages**: Choose which locales to translate into
- **App Directory**: Specify the directory if you're using a monorepo (e.g., `apps/web/`)
- **Branch Prefix**: Customize the prefix for branches Locadex creates (default: `locadex/`)

### Step 6: Complete Installation

1. Review your configuration settings
2. Click "Install" to activate Locadex for your repository
3. You'll be taken to an overview page showing your connected GitHub repository

## What Happens Next

### Initial Setup (First Time)

Once you complete the installation:

1. **Immediate PR Creation**: Locadex will create a pull request on your main branch
2. **Full Setup**: This PR runs the complete Locadex setup command that:
   - Installs our libraries
   - Configures your project for internationalization
   - Sets up the translation infrastructure
3. **Review & Merge**: Review the PR and merge it to complete your i18n setup

### Ongoing Operation

After the initial setup is merged:

1. **Automatic Monitoring**: Locadex monitors your main branch for new commits
2. **Change Detection**: When you push new code with translatable content
3. **Incremental Updates**: Locadex creates new PRs that only internationalize the new changes
4. **Continuous i18n**: Your app stays translated without manual intervention

## Monitoring Your Repository

### Dashboard Status

In your GT dashboard, you can monitor:

- **Repository Status**: Active monitoring indicator
- **Configuration**: Current settings and target languages

### GitHub Integration

- **Status Checks**: Locadex adds status updates to pull requests
- **Check Runs**: GitHub shows Locadex processing status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Locadex not creating PRs**
- Verify the GitHub app has repository access
- Check that commits contain translatable content

**Configuration changes needed**
- Update branch settings in your GT dashboard
- Changes apply to new commits after the update
