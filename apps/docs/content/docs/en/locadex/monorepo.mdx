description: How to use Locadex with a monorepo
---

## Setup 

Locadex can be used with a monorepo setup. To do this, simply provide the `--app-dir` flag with the path to your app directory when running any `locadex` command.

```bash
npx locadex start --app-dir packages/my-app
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Important**: Make sure you are running the command in the root of your monorepo!
</Callout>

## Multiple apps

Currently, Locadex only supports internationalizing a single app at a time.

If your monorepo contains multiple apps you want to internationalize, you can run the command multiple times, once for each app.

You'll need to also specify the `--match-files` flag with the path to the files you want to internationalize.

```bash
npx locadex start --app-dir packages/my-app \
  --match-files "packages/my-app/**/*.{tsx,ts}"

npx locadex start --app-dir packages/my-other-app \
  --match-files "packages/my-other-app/**/*.{tsx,ts}"
```

## Shared UI libraries

If your monorepo contains shared UI libraries, you can specify additional, comma-separated glob patterns to match the files you want to internationalize.

```bash
npx locadex start --app-dir packages/my-app \
  --match-files "packages/my-app/**/*.{tsx,ts}, packages/ui-library/**/*.{tsx,ts}"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to specify the `--app-dir` flag! Without an app directory, Locadex may not be able to find the correct app configuration.
