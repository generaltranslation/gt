## Overview

Branching components in `gt-react` enable dynamic content rendering based on specific conditions. These components include:

- [`<Branch>`](/docs/react/api/components/branch): Renders content based on a matching `branch` prop.
- [`<Plural>`](/docs/react/api/components/plural): Renders content based on pluralization rules for a given number.

Both components provide powerful tools for managing conditional logic and dynamic content in localized applications.

## What are branch components?

Branch components dynamically choose which content to render based on a specific condition or value.

### `<Branch>`

The `<Branch>` component allows you to render different content based on a provided `branch` value.
If no matching branch is found, the fallback `children` content is rendered.

For example, the `<Branch>` component is perfect for conditional rendering based on application state, user preferences, or any dynamic data.

The most common use case is to use it to replace a ternary or conditional operator.

### `<Plural>`

The `<Plural>` component extends the functionality of `<Branch>` by handling pluralization and number agreement automatically.
It uses the provided `n` value to determine which plural form to display, based on locale-specific rules.

For example, the `<Plural>` component is ideal for rendering singular and plural text dynamically, such as "1 item" vs. "2 items."

Plural components are often combined with `<Num>` components to localize a number and its corresponding text.

### Use with `<T>`

The `<Branch>` and `<Plural>` components should be used within a [`<T>`](/docs/react/guides/jsx) component to sanitize dynamic content for translation.

When used within a `<T>` component, the content is automatically translated and rendered in your user's selected language.

When used standalone, they will just render the content as-is, without translating it.

## How to use branch components

### Branching logic with `<Branch>`

The `<Branch>` component is used for flexible content switching based on a `branch` value.

You can define multiple possible branches, and the component will render the content corresponding to the matching branch key.

Additionally, you can use other variable components in combination with the `<Branch>` component.

```tsx 
const branch: 'option1' | 'option2' = 'option1';
<T>
  <Branch 
    branch={branch}
    option1={<p>Option 1</p>}
    option2={<p>Option 2</p>}
  >
    Fallback content
  </Branch>
</T>
```

The `<Branch>` component should be used within a `<T>` component. This allows for the content to be automatically translated.

See the [API Reference](/docs/react/api/components/branch) for more details.

### Pluralization with `<Plural>` [#plural-logic]

The `<Plural>` component automates pluralization logic based on the value of `n`.
The component dynamically chooses the appropriate plural form for the given number and locale.

```tsx copy
const count: number = 1;
<T>
  <Plural
    n={count}
    singular={<><Num>{1}</Num> item.</>}
    plural={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    // Additional options
    zero={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    one={<><Num>{count}</Num> item.</>}
    two={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    few={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    many={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    other={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
    dual={<><Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
  />
</T>
```

The available plural forms depend on the locale and follow [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).

See the [API Reference](/docs/react/api/components/plural) for more details.

## When to use branch components

Branch components are important for managing dynamic content in your application.

When you need to display different content based on a condition, use `<Branch>`.

These conditions can be based on a variable component, a boolean, or a function.

For example, if your code has a ternary operator or conditional rendering, you can use `<Branch>` to replace it.

<Tabs items={["Result", "Original"]}>
  <Tab value="Result">
    ```tsx
    const isActive = true;
    // Ternary operator
    <Branch branch={isActive} true={<p>The user is active.</p>} false={<p>The user is inactive.</p>}>
      <p>Status unknown.</p>
    </Branch>

    // Conditional rendering
    <Branch branch={isActive} true={<p>The user is active.</p>}>
      <></>
    </Branch>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Original">
    ```tsx
    // Ternary operator
    const isActive = true;
    {isActive ? <p>The user is active.</p> : <p>The user is inactive.</p>}

    // Conditional rendering
    {isActive && <p>The user is active.</p>}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you want to render content with correct pluralization, use `<Plural>`.

<Tabs items={["Result", "Original"]}>
  <Tab value="Result">
    ```tsx
    const count = 1;
    <Plural n={count} one={<p>1 item</p>} other={<p>{count} items</p>} />
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Original">
    ```tsx
    const count = 1;
    {count === 1 ? <p>1 item</p> : <p>{count} items</p>}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
  The `<Branch>` and `<Plural>` components can be used standalone, without a `<T>` component.
  When used standalone, they will just render the content as-is, without translating it.

  However, they are often used within a [`<T>`](/docs/react/guides/jsx) component to sanitize dynamic content for translation.

## Examples

### `<Branch>`

```tsx copy
import { T, Branch, Var } from 'gt-react';

export default function UserStatus() {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<'active' | 'inactive' | undefined>(undefined);
  const [name, setName] = useState<string>('John Doe');
  return (
    <T>
      <Branch
        branch={status}
        active={<p>The user <Var>{name}</Var> is active.</p>}
        inactive={<p>The user <Var>{name}</Var> is inactive.</p>}
      >
        <p>Status unknown.</p>
      </Branch>
    </T>
  );
}
```
In the example above, the `<Branch>` component dynamically switches between 3 rendered contents based on the value of `status`.

When `status` is `"active"`, the component renders:
```tsx
<p>The user <Var>{name}</Var> is active.</p>
```

When `status` is `"inactive"`, the component renders:
```tsx
<p>The user <Var>{name}</Var> is inactive.</p>
```

When `status` is neither `"active"` nor `"inactive"`, the component renders the fallback content:
```tsx
<p>Status unknown.</p>
```

Since the `<Branch>` component is wrapped in a `<T>` component, the rendered content is automatically translated in context.


In this example, it displays different descriptions based on the user's subscription plan.
```tsx copy
import { Branch } from 'gt-react';

export default function SubscriptionDetails() {
  const [plan, setPlan] = useState<'free' | 'premium' | 'enterprise' | undefined>(undefined);
  return (
    <Branch
      branch={plan}
      free={<p>You are on the Free plan. Upgrade to unlock more features!</p>}
      premium={<p>You are enjoying the Premium plan with full access to features.</p>}
      enterprise={<p>You are on the Enterprise plan. Contact support for tailored solutions.</p>}
    >
      <p>No subscription plan detected.</p>
    </Branch>
  );
}
```

 * The `branch` prop determines which plan message to display.
 * If `plan` is `"free"`, `"premium"`, or `"enterprise"`, the corresponding message is shown.
 * If `plan` doesn't match any of these values, the fallback content (`"No subscription plan detected."`) is displayed.


### `<Plural>`

The `<Plural>` component dynamically handles singular and plural content based on the value of `n`.
This example displays the number of unread messages in a user's inbox.

```tsx copy
import { T, Plural, Num } from 'gt-react';

export default function UnreadMessages() {
  const [unreadCount, setUnreadCount] = useState<number>(1);
  return (
    <T>
      <Plural
        n={unreadCount}
        one={<>You have <Num>{unreadCount}</Num> unread message.</>}
        other={<>You have <Num>{unreadCount}</Num> unread messages.</>}
      />
    </T>
  );
}
```
 * The `n` prop specifies the number of unread messages.
 * If `unreadCount` is `1`, the component renders: `"You have 1 unread message."`
 * For any other value, it renders: `"You have X unread messages."` where `X` is the value of `unreadCount` formatted by `<Num>`.

## Common Pitfalls

### Missing Branch Values [#missing-branch]

If a branch value is not provided or does not match any keys, the `<Branch>` component will render the fallback children content.
Always ensure that the possible branch keys match the values passed to the branch prop.

```tsx copy
import { Branch } from 'gt-react';

export default function StatusMessage({ status }) {
  return (
    <Branch
      branch={status}
      active={<p>The user is active.</p>}
      inactive={<p>The user is inactive.</p>}
    >
      <p>Status unknown.</p>
    </Branch>
  );
}
```
If `status` is `undefined` or a value other than `active` or `inactive`, the fallback content `“Status unknown.”` will be displayed.


### Missing Plural Forms [#plural-locale]

Remember to specify all necessary plural forms in your default language.
This is how `gt-react` ensures that your application always has fallback content to display.

For example, if English is your default language, you should provide all plural forms for English.

```tsx copy
import { Plural, Num } from 'gt-react';

<Plural
  n={count}
  one={<>You have <Num>{count}</Num> unread message.</>}
  other={<>You have <Num>{count}</Num> unread messages.</>}
/>
```

Here, we have provided `one` and `other` plural forms for English.

Alternatively, you can also provide `singular` and `plural` for English.

## Notes
 * Branch components are essential for managing dynamic and localized content in applications.
 * The `<Branch>` component is highly flexible and can adapt to various conditions and states.
 * The `<Plural>` component simplifies pluralization by adhering to locale-specific rules automatically.
 * Always include a fallback `children` prop for better error handling and user experience.
