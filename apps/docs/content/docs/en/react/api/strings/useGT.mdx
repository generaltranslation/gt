title: useGT()
description: API Reference for the useGT() string translation function
---

## Overview

The `useGT()` function is a hook for translating strings at build time.

```jsx
const t = useGT();

<p>{  t('This text will be translated')  }</p>;
```

<Callout>
**Buildtime Translation:**
`useGT()` translations occur at buildtime, before your app deploys.
Though you can pass variables to the translated string, you can only translate content known at build time.
</Callout>

## Reference
### Parameters
None

### Returns

A callback function, `t()`, which translates the provided content.

```jsx
(content: string, options?: InlineTranslationOptions) => string
```

| Name                  | Type | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `content`             | `string` | The string content to be translated.                                     |
| `options?`            | [`InlineTranslationOptions`](/docs/react/api/types/InlineTranslationOptions) | Translation options to customize the behavior of `t()`. |

## Behavior


### Production
During the CD process, any content inside of a `t()` function will be translated before your application is deployed.
This ensures fast load times for all locales, but it can only translate content known at build time.

Once generated, translations are either (1) stored in the CDN or (2) stored in your app's build output, according to your configuration.
From there, the translated content is served to your users.
If a translation is not found, it will fallback to the originial content.

Make sure to follow the [deployment guide here](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy).

### Development
During development, the `t()` function will translate content on demand.
This is useful for prototyping what your app will look like in different languages.
Remember to add a Dev API key to your environment to enable this behavior.

You will see a delay during on demand translation in development.
This will not occur during for production builds.

## Example

### Basic Usage
You can use `useGT()` to translate strings.

```javascript copy
import { useGT } from 'gt-react';

export default function TranslateGreeting() {
  const t = useGT();

  return (
    <p>
      {t('Hello, Alice!')}
    </p>
  );
}
```
Note: "Alice" will be translated to the user's preferred language.


### Using variables [#variables]
You can pass variables to dictionary translations.

```javascript copy
import { useGT } from 'gt-react';

export default function TranslateGreeting() {
  const t = useGT();

  return (
    <p>
      {t('Hello, {name}!', { variables: { name: 'Alice' } })}
    </p>
  );
}
```
Note: "Alice" will not translated to the user's preferred language because it is a variable.

## Notes
 * The `useGT()` function is a hook for translating strings.
 * The `useGT()` hook can only be used within a component wrapped by a [`<GTProvider>` component](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).
 * Translations strings with `useGT()` happen before runtime, during the build process (unless in development).

## Next steps
 * See [`useDict()`](/docs/react/api/dictionary/useDict) for translating strings using a dictionary.
 * See [`InlineTranslationOptions`](/docs/react/api/types/InlineTranslationOptions) for more information on customizing translations.
