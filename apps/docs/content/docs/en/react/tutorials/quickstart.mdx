### Prerequisites

- A React project using a supported framework (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript

## Installation

Install the `gt-react` and `gtx-cli` packages:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i --save-dev gtx-cli
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add --save-dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  **Automatic Setup:** We have an experimental Setup Wizard that can help you setup your project with `gt-react`.

  Try it out by running `npx gtx-cli@latest`. You'll still need to manually internationalize strings, but it will help you get started.

  See the [Setup Wizard](/docs/cli/init) reference guide for more information. 

  Alternatively, if you would like your AI tool like Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf to automatically setup your project, 
  you can use our [mcp server](/docs/platform/ai-tools).
</Callout>


## Configuration

### `GTProvider`

The core of `gt-react` is the `GTProvider` component.

It is responsible for:

- Managing the user's current locale
- Providing relevant translations to your application
- Providing context to hooks for accessing translations
- Providing context to hooks for changing the user's locale

<Steps>
  <Step>
    First, add the `GTProvider` component to your application. It should be placed as high up in your component tree as possible.

    ```tsx copy title="src/App.tsx"
    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <GTProvider>
          <App />
        </GTProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Next, create a [`gt.config.json`](/docs/react/api/config/gt-config-json) file in the root of your project.
    This file is used to configure both the `gtx-cli` tool and the `gt-react` library.

    ```json title="gt.config.json" copy
    {
      "defaultLocale": "en",
      "locales": ["fr", "es"]
    }
    ```
    You should customize the `defaultLocale` and `locales` to match your project. See the list of [supported locales](/docs/platform/locale-strings) for more information.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Lastly, spread the `gt.config.json` file into the provider's props.

    ```tsx
    import gtConfig from './gt.config.json';

    <GTProvider {...gtConfig}>
      <App />
    </GTProvider>
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      Spreading the `gt.config.json` file makes the config consistent across your application and CLI tool.

      Alternatively, you can individually specify each prop in the `GTProvider` component.

      ```tsx
      <GTProvider
        defaultLocale="en"
        locales={["fr", "es"]}
      >
      ```
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

<Tabs items={["Vite", "Next.js Pages Router", "Gatsby", "RedwoodJS",  "create-react-app", "Other"]}>
    <Tab value="Vite">
    ```bash copy
    VITE_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Gatsby">
    ```bash copy
    GATSBY_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    GATSBY_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="RedwoodJS">
    ```bash copy
    REDWOOD_ENV_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    REDWOOD_ENV_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Next.js Pages Router">
    ```bash copy
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="create-react-app">
    ```bash copy
    REACT_APP_GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
    REACT_APP_GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Other">
    Many react frameworks each have a unique way of exporting environment variables to the client.
    In development environments, both `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` need to be exported to the client.

    We have added support for a few libraries so far,
    but please let us know if your framework is not listed by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generaltranslation/gt/issues/new).
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Make sure your API key variable is only set in your development environment! It should not be set in production.**
</Callout>

You can get a free API key and project ID by creating a [General Translation account](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/signup).

After creating an account, navigate to the [Development API Keys](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/settings/dev-api-keys) page to get your Dev API key and project ID.

Alternatively, you can also use the CLI tool command [`npx gtx-cli auth`](/docs/cli/auth) to generate an API key and project ID for your project, saved to your `.env.local` file.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to use the General Translation platform?">
  `gt-react` is an i18n library that can work standalone without any environment variables.
  Without them, the library will act very similarly to other i18n libraries, and will still have core internationalization functionality.

  However, `gt-react` also offers a native integration with the General Translation platform.
  This integration unlocks additional functionality in the library, such as:

  - Translation Hot Reloading in Development
  - Automatic AI translations
  - Syncing translations with the General Translation platform
  - Native integration with our translation CDN

  To avoid using the General Translation platform, just don't set any environment variables.

## Usage

Great! If you've followed the steps above, your React project is now setup to use `gt-react`.

The next step is to internationalize your content. 
Here, we'll give a brief overview of the different ways to translate content in your application.


### `<T>` Component

The `<T>` component is the main component for translating JSX content in your application.

To use it, simply wrap the JSX you want to translate in the `<T>` component.

```tsx
import { T } from 'gt-react';
<T>
  <div>Your content</div>
</T>
```

If you have dynamic content, you'll need to use [variable components](/docs/react/guides/variables) to pass in the dynamic values.

```tsx
import { T, Var } from 'gt-react';

<T>
  <div>Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>!</div>
</T>
```

See the [Translating JSX](/docs/react/guides/jsx) guide for more information.


### `useGT` Hook

The `useGT` hook is a React hook that returns a function that can be used to translate strings.

```tsx
import { useGT } from 'gt-react';

const translate = useGT();
translate('Hello, world!');
```

See the [Translating Strings](/docs/react/guides/strings) guide for more information.


<Callout type="info">
  Utilizing the hot-reload translation functionality will be helpful for internationalizing your application.

  To enable this, make sure you have the `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` environment variables set in your development environment.
</Callout>

## Testing Your App

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ If you've followed the steps above, your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/react/api/components/localeSelector) component to your app.
    This will allow you to select a different language for your app.
    <Callout>
      **Tip:**
      You can also skip this step and just change your language in your browser settings.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your React app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)

    If this does not work, make sure that the list of locales in your [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is up to date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the setup tool automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that will automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, please follow [this guide](/docs/react/guides/strings) for translating strings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some translations inaccurate?">
    The most likely cause of an inaccurate translation is ambiguous wording.
    For example, "apple" can be a fruit or a technology company.

    To fix this, you can provide more context to the translation with the `context` prop.
    The [`<T>`](/docs/react/api/components/t) and [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) functions support a `context` prop.
    For example:
    ```jsx
    <T context="the technology company">Apple</T>
    ```    
    See our [guide on the `<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/jsx) for more information.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Deployment

Great! If you're satisfied with your translations and the functionality of your app, you can now deploy your application.

The behavior of `gt-react` in production is slightly different from development. Specifically, no translations will be performed at runtime.

This means that you'll need to translate your content before deploying your application, in the build process.

Luckily, the `gtx-cli` tool has a `translate` command that can be used to automatically translate your content.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    First, you'll need to get a Production API key from the [General Translation platform](https://dash.generaltranslation.com).

    Please note that this key is different from your Development API key, and begins with `gtx-api-`, instead of `gtx-dev-`.

    Read about the difference between Development and Production keys [here](/docs/react/concepts/environments).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add this environment variable to your CI/CD pipeline.

    ```bash
    GT_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
    GT_API_KEY=<your-production-api-key>
    ```
    <Callout type='warn'>
      Make sure that `GT_API_KEY` is **NOT** prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or `VITE_`, depending on your framework!

      If it is, you'll risk exposing your API key to the public.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the `translate` command to translate your content.

    ```bash
    npx gtx-cli translate
    ```
    You can configure the behavior of the `translate` command with the [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file.

    See the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide for more information.
    
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the `translate` command to your build process.

    ```json title="package.json" copy
    {
      "scripts": {
        "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <...YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND...>"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not using the General Translation platform?">
    If you're not using the General Translation platform, you can still use `gt-react` in production.

    However, you'll need to manually translate your content before deploying your application.

    Instead of running `translate`, run the `generate` command to generate JSON files containing all of your translation data (in your source language).

    ```bash
    npx gtx-cli generate
    ```

    Then, you'll need to manually edit / translate these files, and load them into your application with [`loadTranslations`](/docs/react/guides/local-tx).
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
