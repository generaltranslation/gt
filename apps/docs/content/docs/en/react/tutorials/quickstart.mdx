Get your React app translating content in minutes.

**Prerequisites:** React, basic JavaScript knowledge

## Installation

Install the `gt-react` and `gtx-cli` packages:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i gtx-cli
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add --dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add --save-dev gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  **Quick Setup:** Try `npx gtx-cli@latest` for automatic configuration. See the [Setup Wizard](/docs/cli/init) guide or use our [AI tools integration](/docs/platform/ai-tools).
</Callout>


## Configuration

### `GTProvider`

The [`GTProvider`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) component provides translation context to your React components. It manages locale state, translations, and enables the [`useGT`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) and [`useTranslations`](/docs/react/api/dictionary/useTranslations) hooks.

Add the [`GTProvider`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) to your root App component:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider>
      <YourAppContent />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```

Create a [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file in your project root:

```json title="gt.config.json"
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["fr", "es", "de"]
}
```

Customize the locales for your project. See [supported locales](/docs/platform/locale-strings) for options.

### Environment Variables

Add to your environment file for development hot-reloading:

<Tabs items={["Vite", "create-react-app", "Gatsby", "RedwoodJS", "Other"]}>
    <Tab value="Vite">
    ```bash title=".env.local"
    VITE_GT_API_KEY="your-dev-api-key"
    VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="create-react-app">
    ```bash title=".env.local"
    REACT_APP_GT_API_KEY="your-dev-api-key"
    REACT_APP_GT_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Gatsby">
    ```bash title=".env.development"
    GATSBY_GT_API_KEY="your-dev-api-key"
    GATSBY_GT_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="RedwoodJS">
    ```bash title=".env"
    REDWOOD_ENV_GT_API_KEY="your-dev-api-key"
    REDWOOD_ENV_GT_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Other">
    Many React frameworks each have a unique way of exporting environment variables to the client.
    In development environments, both `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` need to be exported to the client.

    We have added support for a few libraries so far,
    but please let us know if your framework is not listed by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generaltranslation/gt/issues/new).
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Development only:** Don't set `GT_API_KEY` in production - it's only for development hot-reloading.
</Callout>

```bash
npx gtx-cli auth
```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to use the General Translation platform?">
  `gt-react` is an i18n library that can work standalone without any environment variables.
  Without them, the library will act very similarly to other i18n libraries, and will still have core internationalization functionality.

  However, `gt-react` also offers a native integration with the General Translation platform.
  This integration unlocks additional functionality in the library, such as:

  - Translation Hot Reloading in Development
  - Automatic AI translations
  - Syncing translations with the General Translation platform
  - Native integration with our translation CDN
  - On-demand translation of React components in production (client-side)

  To avoid using the General Translation platform, just don't set any environment variables.
  </Accordion>

## Usage

Now you can start internationalizing your content. There are two main approaches:

### JSX Content with `<T>`

Wrap JSX elements to translate them using the [`<T>`](/docs/react/api/components/t) component:

```tsx
import { T } from 'gt-react';

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <T>
      <h1>Welcome to our app!</h1>
    </T>
  );
}
```

For dynamic content, use [variable components](/docs/react/guides/variables) like [`<Var>`](/docs/react/api/components/var):

```tsx
import { T, Var } from 'gt-react';

function Greeting({ user }) {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>Hello, <Var>{user.name}</Var>!</p>
    </T>
  );
}
```

See the guide on [using the `<T>` component](/docs/react/guides/t) for more information.

### Plain Strings with `useGT`

For attributes, labels, and plain text using the [`useGT`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) hook:

```tsx
import { useGT } from 'gt-react';

function ContactForm() {
  const t = useGT();
  
  return (
    <input 
      placeholder={t('Enter your email')}
      aria-label={t('Email input field')}
    />
  );
}
```

See the guide on [translating strings](/docs/react/guides/strings) for more information.

## Testing Your App

Test your translations by switching languages:

1. **Add a locale selection dropdown** using [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/react/api/components/localeSelector):
   ```tsx
   import { LocaleSelector } from 'gt-react';
   
   function App() {
     return <LocaleSelector />;
   }
   ```
   
2. **Start your dev server**:
   <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

3. **Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and change languages via the locale selection dropdown.

In development, translations happen on-demand (you'll see a brief loading time). In production, everything is pre-translated.

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do languages take a long time to load in dev?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some translations inaccurate?">
    The most likely cause of an inaccurate translation is ambiguous wording.
    For example, "apple" can be a fruit or a technology company.

    To fix this, you can provide more context to the translation with the `context` prop.
    The [`<T>`](/docs/react/api/components/t) and [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) functions all support a `context` prop.
    For example:
    ```jsx
    <T context="the technology company">Apple</T>
    ```    
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Deployment

For production, you need to pre-translate content since runtime translation is disabled (except for [`<Tx>`](/docs/react/api/components/tx) and [`tx()`](/docs/react/api/strings/tx) functions).

1. **Get a production API key** from [dash.generaltranslation.com](https://dash.generaltranslation.com). 
   
   Production keys begin with `gtx-api-` (different from dev keys which start with `gtx-dev-`). Learn more about [environment differences](/docs/react/concepts/environments).

2. **Add to your CI/CD environment**:
   ```bash
   GT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   GT_API_KEY=gtx-api-your-production-key
   ```
   <Callout type="warn">
     **Never** prefix production keys with your framework's public variable prefix (like `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, etc.) - they should remain server-side only.
   </Callout>

3. **Run the translate command** to translate your content:
   ```bash
   npx gtx-cli translate
   ```
   
   You can configure the behavior of the translate command with the [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file.
   
   See the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide for more information.

4. **Update your build script** to translate before building:
   ```json title="package.json"
   {
     "scripts": {
       "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <...YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND...>"
     }
   }
   ```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not using the General Translation platform?">
    If you're not using the General Translation platform, you can still use `gt-react` in production.

    However, you'll need to manually translate your content before deploying your application.

    Instead of running `translate`, run the `generate` command to generate JSON files containing all of your translation data (in your source language).

    ```bash
    npx gtx-cli generate
    ```

    Then, you'll need to manually edit / translate these files, and load them into your application with [`loadTranslations`](/docs/react/guides/local-tx).
