title: Using the <T> Component
description: Let's do some translation!
---



## Overview

It's finally time to do some translating!
Once you set up your `<T>` components, you can translate your app into any language you want!

Really this breaks down into two steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Adding the `<GTProvider>` component
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Adding the `<T>` component
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Add the `<GTProvider>` Component

Let's start by adding the `<GTProvider>` component to your app.
The nice thing is that this only has to be done once.

```jsx title="src/app/layout.tsx" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next' // [!code highlight]
...
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
      >
        <GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
            {children}
        </GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```

  **Why do we need the `<GTProvider>` component?**

  The `<GTProvider>` is responsible for passing translations from the server to the client.
  Any time we want to render a `<T>` component on the client side, we need to wrap it in a `<GTProvider>`.

  You can read more about the `<GTProvider>` component [here](/docs/next/guides/jsx#gtprovider).

## Add the `<T>` Component

The part you have been waiting for...

Now all we have to do is put a `<T>` at the top of the content and a closing `</T>` at the end.
Don't forget to add a unique identifier string to act as the id for the translation.

```jsx title="src/app/page.tsx" copy
import { T } from 'gt-next' // [!code highlight]
...
function Page() {
  ...

  return (
    <T id="currency-converter"> // [!code highlight]
      ...
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}

export default Page;
```

And that's it! You're now ready to start translating your app!
