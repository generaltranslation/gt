  ### Prerequisites

  - A Next.js application using the App Router
  - Basic knowledge of Next.js and JavaScript

  ## Installation

  Install the `gt-next` and `gtx-cli` packages:

  <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun', 'pnpm']}>
    <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash 
    npm i gt-next
    npm i --save-dev gtx-cli
    ``` 
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash 
    yarn add gt-next
    yarn add --dev gtx-cli
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash 
    bun add gt-next
    bun add --dev gtx-cli
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash 
    pnpm add gt-next
    pnpm add --save-dev gtx-cli
    ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  <Callout type="info">
    **Automatic Setup:** We have an experimental Setup Wizard that can help you setup your project with `gt-next`.

    Try it out by running `npx gtx-cli@latest`. You'll still need to manually internationalize content, but it will help you get started.

    See the [Setup Wizard](/docs/cli/init) reference guide for more information. 

    Alternatively, if you would like your AI tool like Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf to automatically setup your project, 
    you can use our [mcp server](/docs/platform/ai-tools).
  </Callout>


  ## Configuration

  ### `withGTConfig`

  The `withGTConfig` function is a function that is used to initialize the SDK in a Next.js application.

  Place this in your `next.config.[js|ts]` file.

  ```tsx title="next.config.ts"
  import { withGTConfig } from 'gt-next/config';

  const nextConfig = {
    // Your next.config.ts options
  };

  export default withGTConfig(nextConfig, {
    // Additional GT configuration options
  });
  ```

  See the [withGTConfig API Reference](/docs/next/api/config/withGTConfig) for more information.

  ### `GTProvider`

  `gt-next` also exports a `GTProvider` component. This component is used to provide context to client-side components in your Next.js application.

  The `GTProvider` and `withGTConfig` work together to provide context to your application.

  This context includes:

  - Managing the user's current locale
  - The relevant translations for that locale
  - Context for the `useGT` hook
  - Context for the `useTranslations` hook


  <Steps>
    <Step>
      First, add the `GTProvider` component to the root layout of your application. It should be placed as high up in your component tree as possible.

      ```tsx copy title="src/layout.tsx"
      import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next';

      export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
        return (
          <html>
            <body>
              <GTProvider>
                {children}
              </GTProvider>
            </body>
          </html>
        );
      }
      ```
      If you have multiple root layouts, place the `GTProvider` in each one.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Next, create a [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file in the root of your project.
      This file is used to configure both the `gtx-cli` tool and the `gt-next` library.

      ```json title="gt.config.json" copy
      {
        "defaultLocale": "en",
        "locales": ["fr", "es"]
      }
      ```
      You should customize the `defaultLocale` and `locales` to match your project. See the list of [supported locales](/docs/platform/locale-strings) for more information.

      `withGTConfig` will automatically detect the `gt.config.json` file in your project, and use it to configure the SDK.
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  ### Environment Variables

  Set the following environment variables:

  ```bash copy
  GT_API_KEY="" # Your General Translation Developer API key
  GT_PROJECT_ID="" # Your General Translation project ID
  ```

  <Callout type="warn">
    **Make sure your API key variable is only set in your development environment! It should not be set in production.**
  </Callout>

  You can get a free API key and project ID by creating a [General Translation account](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/signup).

  After creating an account, navigate to the [Development API Keys](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/settings/dev-api-keys) page to get your Dev API key and project ID.

  Alternatively, you can also use the CLI tool command [`npx gtx-cli auth`](/docs/cli/auth) to generate an API key and project ID for your project, saved to your `.env.local` file.

  <Accordions>
    <Accordion title="What if I don't want to use the General Translation platform?">
    `gt-next` is an i18n library that can work standalone without any environment variables.
    Without them, the library will act very similarly to other i18n libraries, and will still have core internationalization functionality.

    However, `gt-next` also offers a native integration with the General Translation platform.
    This integration unlocks additional functionality in the library, such as:

    - Translation Hot Reloading in Development
    - Automatic AI translations
    - Syncing translations with the General Translation platform
    - Native integration with our translation CDN
    - On-demand translation of React components in production (on the server side)

    To avoid using the General Translation platform, just don't set any environment variables.

  ## Usage

  Great! If you've followed the steps above, your Next.js app is now setup to use `gt-next`.

  The next step is to internationalize your content. 
  Here, we'll give a brief overview of the different ways to translate content in your application.

  ### `<T>` Component

  The `<T>` component is the main component for translating JSX content in your application.

  To use it, simply wrap the JSX you want to translate in the `<T>` component.

  ```tsx
  import { T } from 'gt-next';
  <T>
    <div>Your content</div>
  </T>
  ```

  If you have dynamic content, you'll need to use [variable components](/docs/next/guides/variables) to pass in the dynamic values.

  ```tsx
  import { T, Var } from 'gt-next';

  <T>
    <div>Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>!</div>
  </T>
  ```

  See the [Translating JSX](/docs/next/guides/jsx) guide for more information.


  ### `useGT` Hook

  The `useGT` hook is a React hook that returns a function that can be used to translate strings.

  ```tsx
  import { useGT } from 'gt-next'

  const translate = useGT();
  translate('Hello, world!');
  ```

  The `useGT` hook can be used in both client-side and server-side components.
  For async components, use the async `getGT()` function instead.


  See the [Translating Strings](/docs/next/guides/strings) guide for more information.


  <Callout type="info">
    Utilizing the hot-reload translation functionality will be helpful for internationalizing your application.

    To enable this, make sure you have the `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` environment variables set in your development environment.
  </Callout>

  ## Testing Your App

  Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ If you've followed the steps above, your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.


  ### See Your App in a Different Language

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      Add the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/next/api/components/localeSelector) component to your app.
      This will allow you to select a different language for your app.
      <Callout>
        **Tip:**
        You can also skip this step and just change your language in your browser settings.
      </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Start your Next.js app in development mode.
      <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
        <Tab value="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run dev 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="yarn">
        ```bash 
        yarn run dev 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="bun">
        ```bash
        bun run dev 
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm run dev 
        ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
      [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  ### Troubleshooting

  <Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
      **Browser Cookies**

      If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

      Check your browser's cookies for your app.
      General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
      The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
      Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
      refresh the page.

      How to check cookies:
      * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
      * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
      * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
      * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do languages take a long time to load in dev?">
      **On-Demand Translation**

      You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
      This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
      We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
      
      This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
      All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
      Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why are some translations inaccurate?">
      The most likely cause of an inaccurate translation is ambiguous wording.
      For example, "apple" can be a fruit or a technology company.

      To fix this, you can provide more context to the translation with the `context` prop.
      The [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t), [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/useGT), and [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/getGT) functions all support a `context` prop.
      For example:
      ```jsx
      <T context="the technology company">Apple</T>
      ```    
    </Accordion>
  </Accordions>

  ## Deployment

  Great! If you're satisfied with your translations and the functionality of your app, you can now deploy your application.

  The behavior of `gt-next` in production is slightly different from development. Specifically, no translations will be performed at runtime (with the exception of the `<Tx>` component & `tx` function).

  This means that you'll need to translate your content before deploying your application, in the build process.

  Luckily, the `gtx-cli` tool has a `translate` command that can be used to automatically translate your content.

  <Steps>
    <Step>
      First, you'll need to get a Production API key from the [General Translation platform](https://dash.generaltranslation.com).

      Please note that this key is different from your Development API key, and begins with `gtx-api-`, instead of `gtx-dev-`.

      Read about the difference between Development and Production keys [here](/docs/next/concepts/environments).
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Add this environment variable to your CI/CD pipeline.

      ```bash
      GT_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
      GT_API_KEY=<your-production-api-key>
      ```
      <Callout type='warn'>
        Make sure that `GT_API_KEY` is **NOT** prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`!

        If it is, you'll risk exposing your API key to the public.
      </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Run the `translate` command to translate your content.

      ```bash
      npx gtx-cli translate
      ```
      You can configure the behavior of the `translate` command with the [`gt.config.json`](/docs/cli/reference/config) file.

      See the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide for more information.
      
    </Step>
    <Step>
      Add the `translate` command to your build process.

      ```json title="package.json" copy
      {
        "scripts": {
          "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <...YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND...>"
        }
      }
      ```
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  <Accordions>
    <Accordion title="What if I'm not using the General Translation platform?">
      If you're not using the General Translation platform, you can still use `gt-next` in production.

      However, you'll need to manually translate your content before deploying your application.

      Instead of running `translate`, run the `generate` command to generate JSON files containing all of your translation data (in your source language).

      ```bash
      npx gtx-cli generate
      ```

      Then, you'll need to manually edit / translate these files, and load them into your application with [`loadTranslations`](/docs/next/guides/local-tx).
    </Accordion>
  </Accordions>
