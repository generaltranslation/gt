  **Note:** We do not recommend using dictionaries if you are using `gt-next`. Instead, please check out the [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component.

  This guide is intended for those who are already familiar with dictionaries and want to learn how to use them with `gt-next`, or those who are 
  trying to migrate from another i18n library to `gt-next`.

## What is a dictionary?

A dictionary is a nested object with string values that can be used to store translatable content.
They can be stored in a `.ts`, `.js`, or `.json` file.

`gt-next` allows you to use dictionaries standalone, or in conjunction with [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) components.

### Dictionary vs `<T>` Components

The dictionary pattern has a few advantages over the [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component:

1. **Centralized Storage**: Dictionaries store all translatable content in a single file.
2. **Historical Precedent**: The dictionary pattern is a common design pattern in the industry and is used by many other i18n libraries.

At the same time, it has several major disadvantages:

1. **Complexity**: Dictionaries are more complex to set up and use than the `<T>` component.
2. **Readability**: Dictionaries are less readable than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline.
3. **Maintainability**: Dictionaries are more difficult to maintain than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline, and is instead stored separately. 
This makes maintaining and updating translations much more difficult.
4. **Debuggability**: For the same reason, dictionaries are more difficult to debug than the `<T>` component.
When trying to debug a React component, you will have to track down where the content in the dictionary is being used, rather than just directly searching your codebase.

Both design patterns are supported by our library and are not mutually exclusive.
You can use a dictionary alongside `<T>` components.

### Our advice

We recommend using the [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component because of its simplicity especially if you are new to internationalization (i18n).
We offer dictionary support for those who prefer this design pattern from past experiences or for ease of integration with existing code bases.

## How to use dictionaries

In this section, we will show you how to set up a bare-bones dictionary implementation in your Next.js application.
We will walk through the following steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Create a dictionary
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Reference the dictionary
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1: Create a dictionary

The first step is to create a dictionary.
This is a `dictionary.[js|ts|json]` file that contains all the content you want to translate.

Add the following content to your `dictionary` file:

```ts title="src/dictionary.ts" copy
const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    hello: 'Hello, world!'
  },
}

export default dictionary;
```

<Callout>
  You can also use a `dictionary.json` file to store your dictionary. This is useful if you are migrating from a different library or if you prefer to use JSON files.
  Here is an example of a `dictionary.json` file:

```json title="src/dictionary.json" copy
{
  "greetings": {
    "hello": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
``` 

</Callout>

The [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withGTConfig) function will automatically pick up the dictionary file in your project root or `src` directory.

### Step 2: Reference the dictionary

You can access dictionary entries with the [`useTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/useTranslations) hook or the [`getTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/getTranslations) function.
Just use the function returned by the hook to access the dictionary entries by key.

<Callout>
  **Note:**
  `useTranslations()` should only be used in synchronous components. For async components, use the `getTranslations()` function instead.
</Callout>

```tsx title="src/components/MyComponent.tsx" copy
import { useTranslations } from 'gt-next';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const d = useTranslations();
  return (
    <div>
      {d('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx title="src/components/MyComponent.tsx" copy
import { getTranslations } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function MyComponent() {
  const d = await getTranslations();
  return (
    <div>
      {d('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Loading dictionaries for other languages [#other-languages]

By default, developers only provide a dictionary for the default language.

General Translation automatically generates dictionaries for other languages and loads them with the [`loadTranslations`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations) function.

However, if you are migrating from another i18n library or already have dictionaries for other languages, you can pass them to the [`loadDictionary`](/docs/next/api/config/load-dictionary) function.

`gt-next` will automatically load the corresponding dictionary for the requested locale when using the `useTranslations()` hook or `getTranslations()` function.

See the [API Reference](/docs/next/api/config/load-dictionary) for more information.

## Using dictionaries [#usage]

### Variables

You can add variables to your dictionary by using the `{variable}` syntax:

```ts title="src/dictionary.ts" copy
const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    hello: 'Hello, {name}!',    // -> Hello, Alice!
    goodbye: 'Goodbye, {name}!' // -> Goodbye, Bob!
  },
}
export default dictionary;
```
```tsx title="src/components/MyComponent.tsx" copy
import { useTranslations } from 'gt-next';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const d = useTranslations();
  return (
    <div>
      {d('greetings.hello', { variables: { name: 'Alice' }})}
      {d('greetings.goodbye', { variables: { name: 'Bob' }})}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Read more about adding variables to your dictionary in the [`DictionaryTranslationOptions` type](/docs/next/api/types/DictionaryTranslationOptions).


### Prefixes

Additionally, with [`useTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/useTranslations), you can pass in a prefix to the function to specify a shared path in the dictionary.
This is useful if you have a shared path in your dictionary that you want to use in multiple components.

```jsx title="src/dictionary.js" copy
const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    common: {
      hello: 'Hello, world!',
      goodbye: 'Goodbye, World!'
    },
  },
}
export default dictionary;
```

```jsx title="src/components/MyComponent.js" copy
import { useTranslations } from 'gt-next';

export default function MyComponent() {
  // All translation paths such as 'hello' will be prefixed with 'greetings.common.'
  const d = useTranslations('greetings.common'); // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <div>
      {d('hello')} {/* hello -> greetings.common.hello */}
      {d('goodbye')} {/* goodbye -> greetings.common.goodbye */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Production considerations

### Deploying to production

Make sure to run the translate command before deploying to production, so that all translations are available at runtime.
We recommend adding it to your in your CD pipeline or as a part of your build script.
```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>",
  }
}
```

For a more detailed guide on deploying your application, please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy) guide.
For more information on the command, please refer to the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide.

### Behavior: Development vs Production

In development, the function returned by the `useTranslations()` hook will translate dictionary entries on-demand.
This means that when the component is rendered, it will perform a translation immediately.
We do this for convenience to make development with other languages easier.

To enable this behavior, just add a [Dev API key](/docs/next/concepts/environments) to your environment.

In production, the `d()` function will translate content at build time.
This means that you have to run the translation command before deploying your application.

<Callout>
  **Tip:**
  If you want to simulate production behavior in development, just use a production API key in your development build.
</Callout>

## Notes
 * Dictionaries are an alternative to the `<T>` component. They can be used in conjunction with `<T>` components or standalone.
 * Dictionary translations occur at build time, so you have to add the [`translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command to your build process.
 * Dictionaries can be used with prefixes to specify a subset of the dictionary.

## Next steps
 * Learn about the [`<T>` component](/docs/next/api/components/t) and how to use it in your Next.js application.
 * Learn how to ship to production with our [deployment guide](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
