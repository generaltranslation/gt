## Overview

This guide will walk you through how to use the [`<Tx>` component](/docs/next/api/components/tx) and the [`tx()`](/docs/next/api/strings/tx) function to translate dynamic content in Next.js server components.

By the end of this guide, you will learn the proper syntax for using these components and functions.

We will cover the following:

## What is dynamic content?

Dynamic content is content that is not known at build time.

These could include things like variables, user names, input fields, etc.

For example, the following is dynamic content:

```jsx
const username = 'John Doe';
<p>Your username is {username}</p>
```

## When should you translate dynamic content?

In most cases, you can use [Variable Components](/docs/next/guides/variables) or [Branching Components](/docs/next/guides/branches) to handle dynamic content.

These components are designed to handle dynamic content with the `<T>` component, and thus we recommend using them whenever possible.

However, there are some cases where you need to translate dynamic content on-demand.

For example, if you have a chat message that is created by a user, and want to display it in a different language, you can use `gt-next` to translate it on-demand.

## How to use the `<Tx>` component

<Callout type="warn">
  The `<Tx>` component is only available in Next.js server components. 
  This is because it hits the General Translation API using an API key, which is only available on the server for security reasons.
</Callout>

```jsx copy
import { Tx } from 'gt-next';

const message = 'Hello, world!';
<Tx>{message}</Tx>
```

Simply wrap whatever JSX content you want to translate with the `<Tx>` component.

The `<Tx>` component will then translate the content on-demand, and render the translated content asynchronously.

See the [API reference](/docs/next/api/components/tx) for more information.

## How to use the `tx()` function

<Callout type="warn">
  The `tx()` function is only available in Next.js server components.
  This is because it hits the General Translation API using an API key, which is only available on the server for security reasons.
</Callout>

The `tx()` function is a server-side function that can be used to translate strings dynamically.

```jsx copy
import { tx } from 'gt-next/server';

const message = 'Hello, world!';
const translatedMessage = await tx(message);
```

The `tx()` function returns a promise that resolves to the translated string.

See the [API reference](/docs/next/api/strings/tx) for more information.

## Examples

### Rendering dynamic content

```jsx copy
import { Tx } from 'gt-next';

export default function ChatMessage({ message }: { message: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Tx>{message}</Tx>
  );
}
```

### Translating a string

```jsx copy
import { tx } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function ChatMessage({ message }: { message: string }) {
  const translatedMessage = await tx(message);
  return (
    <div>{translatedMessage}</div>
  );
}
```

## Production considerations

The behavior of the `<Tx>` component and the `tx()` function is the same in development as it is in production.

Regardless of the type of API key you use, the behavior is the same.
In both cases, translations are completed live, on-demand.

## Common pitfalls

### Unnecessary use of `<Tx>` and `tx()`

If you are using the `<Tx>` component or the `tx()` function, you should only do so if you are truly unable to use
[Variable Components](/docs/next/guides/variables) or [Branching Components](/docs/next/guides/branches) with the `<T>` component.

Using `<Tx>` and `tx()` when you don't need to is a waste of resources, and will quickly use up your API quota.

Additionally, your content will be rendered slower, as the translations are completed on-demand.
