description: A step by step guide on adding Right-to-Left (RTL) support to your application
---

## Overview

While most languages are written left-to-right (LTR), some languages are written right-to-left (RTL).
These languages include Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu which have a combined total of over 500 million speakers worldwide.

Look at the General Translation landing page in [English](https://generaltranslation.com/en-US/welcome)
and [Arabic](https://generaltranslation.com/ar/welcome) to illustrate the difference between ltr and rtl rendering.

## Guide

To add RTL support to your application, all we need to do to is determine the direction of the language and set the direction of
the text on the screen accordingly.

You can use the `useLocaleDirection()` hook to determine if a language goes `"rtl"` or `"ltr"`.

Use the `useLocale()` function to get the locale in the root layout, then add the `lang` and `dir` props to the `<html>` tag:

```javascript title="my-app/app/layout.tsx" copy
import { useLocale, useLocaleDirection, GTProvider } from 'gt-next'

export default async function RootLayout({ children }) {
        
  const locale = useLocale(); // e.g. "ar" for Arabic
  const dir = useLocaleDirection(); // e.g. "rtl" for "right-to-left"

  return (
    <html lang={locale} dir={dir}>
      <body> 
        <GTProvider>
          {children}
        </GTProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
