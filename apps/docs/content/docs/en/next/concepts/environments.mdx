description: Differences between production and development environments

## Overview

`gt-next` behaves differently depending on the environment your Next.js application is running in.

It detects the environment by checking the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.


## Production Behavior

### Environment Variables

In production, `gt-next` will only read the `GT_PROJECT_ID` and `GT_API_KEY` environment variables.

The API Key must be a Production API Key, beginning with `gtx-api-`.

If you are using a Development API Key, `gt-next` will throw an error.

### Translation Loading Behavior

In production, `gt-next` will attempt to load translations from the General Translation CDN, by default.

If you have configured custom translation loading behavior, such as local translations, via the `loadTranslations` function, `gt-next` will use that instead.

Translation hot reloading is disabled since it is in production.

On-demand translation for dynamic content using the `<Tx>` component or `tx()` function is enabled, but only in server components.

## Development Behavior

### Environment Variables

`gt-next` will accept the `GT_PROJECT_ID` and `GT_API_KEY` environment variables.

The API key can either be a Production API Key, beginning with `gtx-api-`, or a Development API Key, beginning with `gtx-dev-`.

If a production API key is provided in development, `gt-next` will behave as if you are in production.
This means that translation hot reloading will be disabled, and components without translations will render the original content.


### Translation Loading Behavior

In development, `gt-next` will first attempt to load translations in the same way as production.
These translations are loaded into memory.

When rendering a component (that uses `useGT()`, `<T>`, or `useTranslations()`) in a language different than the default, `gt-next` will do the following:

1. If it detects a valid, stored translation for the given content, it will render the translation.
2. If no translation is found, it will attempt to dynamically translate the content via the General Translation API.
3. After translating, the translation will be rendered, and stored in memory for future use.
4. If the translation times out, it will fallback and render the original content.

<Callout type="info">
  Our API also internally caches development translations for a short period of time, so if the same translation is requested again, it will be served from cache.

  These translations are isolated at the project level, so they will not be mixed up with translations from other projects.
  Additionally, the cache is unique to development sessions, so cached translations will not be used in production.
</Callout>

`gt-next` will detect changes to components that use `useGT()`, `<T>`, or `useTranslations()` and will dynamically translate the modified content via our API.


## Production vs Development API Keys [#api-keys]

To help distinguish between the production and development behavior of `gt-next`, we have the concept of "Production API Keys" and "Development API Keys".

### Production API Keys

Production API keys are API keys beginning with `gtx-api-`.

When a Production API key is provided, `gt-next` will behave as described in the [Production Behavior](#production-behavior) section.

This means that if you are running your Next.js application in development mode, and you provide a Production API key, `gt-next` will behave as if you are in production.
Translation hot reloading will be disabled, and components without translations will render the original content.

Other than this behavior, `gt-next` will not utilize the Production API key in any way.

<Callout type="info">
  The CLI tool reads the `GT_API_KEY` environment variable and only accepts Production API keys.

  The CLI tool will apply billing and rate-limiting using the "production" category.
</Callout>

### Development API Keys

Development API keys are API keys beginning with `gtx-dev-`.

When a Development API key is provided, `gt-next` will behave as described in the [Development Behavior](#development-behavior) section.

When using a Development API key, billing and rate-limiting will be applied using the "development" category.

<Callout type="warn">
  Translations created with a Development API key will not be stored, and will not be available for use in production.

  The purpose of development translations is to allow you to test your application before shipping to production.
</Callout>
