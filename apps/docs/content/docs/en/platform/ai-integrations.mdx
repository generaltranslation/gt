## Overview

We provide several tools to help your AI tools work with General Translation.

## llms.txt

Provide your AI tools with our [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file for a brief summary of our docs in a LLM-friendly format.

## llms-full.txt

Provide your AI tools with our [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) file for the full content of our docs in a LLM-friendly format.

## MCP Server

We also host an MCP server at `https://mcp.gtx.dev`.
This server is a simple MCP server that AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code can use to access our docs.

Add the following to your mcp config file to use our MCP server.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

For tools that don't support streamable-http, you can use the SSE endpoint instead.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the MCP Server

Make sure you've added the MCP server to your mcp config file.

### Cursor

To use the MCP server in Cursor, simply ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` tool.

For example, you can ask the AI: "Use the generaltranslation tool to explain how to use a `<T>` component."
