description: General Translation support for AI Tools including llms.txt and MCP server
---

## Overview

We provide several tools to help your AI tools work with General Translation.

## llms.txt

Provide your AI tools with our [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file for a brief summary of our docs in a LLM-friendly format.

## llms-full.txt

Provide your AI tools with our [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) file for the full content of our docs in a LLM-friendly format.

## MCP Server

We offer a simple MCP server that AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code can use to access our docs.

Add the following to your mcp config file to use our MCP server.

### Local MCP Server

For AI tools which maintain a persistent connection such as **Windsurf** and **Cursor**, you can run our local MCP docs server.

```json title="mcp.json" copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@generaltranslation/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Streamable-HTTP

Otherwise, you can use our MCP server hosted at `https://mcp.gtx.dev`.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

### SSE

For tools that don't support streamable-http, you can use the SSE endpoint instead.

```json title=".mcp.json"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "generaltranslation": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.gtx.dev/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the MCP Server

Make sure you've added the MCP server to your mcp config file.

### Cursor

To use the MCP server in Cursor, simply ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` tool.

For example, you can ask the AI: "Use the generaltranslation tool to explain how to use a `<T>` component."

### Windsurf

To use the MCP server in Windsurf, ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` mcp server.

For example, you can ask the AI: "Use the generaltranslation mcp server to explain how to use a `<T>` component."

### Claude Code

To use the MCP server in Claude Code, ask the AI to use the `generaltranslation` mcp server.
