description: How to use the CDN to serve your translations

<Callout>
  This feature is currently only supported for apps using `gt-next` or `gt-react`.
</Callout>

## Overview

When you translate your `gt-next` or `gt-react` app, we automatically serve your translations from our CDN.

In production, `gt-next` and `gt-react` will lazy-load these translations from the CDN if your users request your app in a different language.
This means that you can internationalize your app without having to worry about latency or bundle size for your users.

With 300+ edge nodes around the world, our CDN ensures that your users will always experience the lowest latency possible when viewing your app in a different language.

## How to use

By default, translations are automatically published to the CDN whenever you run `gtx-cli translate`.
However, you can disable it if you need to.

1. Go to the [project settings page](https://dash.generaltranslation.com/settings/project).
2. Toggle the "Publish to CDN" switch.
3. Re-run the `gtx-cli translate` command.

<Callout>
  If you disable the CDN, make to that you've set up your app to use local translations. [gt-next](/docs/next/guides/local-tx) or [gt-react](/docs/react/guides/local-tx)
