## Overview

General Translation provides powerful tools to translate entire files in your project directly through the CLI. This allows you to translate:

- **JSON Files**: Translate your i18n JSON files for any library including next-intl, i18next, or custom JSON formats
- **Markdown/MDX Files**: Translate your documentation or content files while preserving all formatting and structure
- **TypeScript/JavaScript Files**: Translate strings in your code files without affecting their functionality

With the GT CLI tool, you can translate entire directories of files with a single command, making it easy to localize your entire project.

## Supported File Types

General Translation supports the following file types:

| File Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `json` | JSON files used by i18n libraries like next-intl, i18next, etc. |
| `mdx` | Markdown component files used for documentation |
| `md` | Standard markdown files |
| `js` | JavaScript files |
| `ts` | TypeScript files |
| `gt` | GT-specific translation files used by gt-next and gt-react |

## How It Works

1. Install the GT CLI tool: `npm install --save-dev gtx-cli`
2. Configure your project with the `gt.config.json` file
3. Run `npx gtx-cli translate` to automatically translate all specified files

That's it! No need to wait days for translations, just run a command and get your translations in minutes.
