title: Dynamic Content
description: A brief overview of working with Dynamic Content in GT.

## Overview

**Dynamic Content** is generally any content that can change based on the user, context, environment, etc.
This exists in contrast to **Static Content**, which remains the same regardless of the user, context, environment, etc.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="What's the difference between dynamic and static content?">
        TL;DR
        * Static Content never changes (raw strings, text, etc.).
        * Dynamic Content can change (names, emails, time, language, etc.).

        **What is Static Content?**

        Static Content generally refers to any raw text that exists in the bundle that is served to your users.
        A good rule of thumb is any text or strings that a developer can read in the source code is static text.

        For example, consider this file:

        ```jsx title="Landing.jsx" copy

        export default function Landing() {
            return (
                <> Welcome to my app!</>
            );
        }
        ```
        
        The text, "Welcome to my app!", is Static Content because it never changes.

        But, what if we wanted to change the page such that it would respond if the user was logged in:

        ```jsx title="Landing.jsx" copy

        export default function Landing(user) {

            if (user) {
                return (
                    <h1> Welcome to my app, {user.name}! </h1>
                );
            }
            
            return (
                <h1> Welcome to my app!</h1>
            );
        }
        ```
        Even though these two phrases are being conditionally rendered, these two phrases are both considered static text.
        Remember our rule of thumb: we can see this content by reading the source code in `landing.jsx`.

        However, `{user.name}` is considered dynamic content, because it can change.
        We cannot know what will get rendered on the user's screen by just reading the `landing.jsx` file.

## "To Tx or not to Tx"
Sometimes, we want to translate dynamic content, but other times we want it to remain the same.


A good example would be a user's email address or name.
Another example might be a bank account balance or a user's SSN.
Such items are (1) not likely to need translation when your app is being rendered in a different language and (2) can vary (in this case between each user).


### Example

```jsx title="Greeting.jsx" copy
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next'

export default function Greeting(name) {
    return (
        <T id='greeting'>
            Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>!
        </T>
    );
}
```

As far as translation goes this has two benefits:
1. You do not have to create a translation for every possible name.
    * Using `<Var>`, we only generate one translation that essentially would look like this:
        * \`¡Hola, $\{name\}!\`
    * If we do not use `<Var>`, we would have to perform an on-demand translation for every unique name:
        * "¡Hola, Alice!", "¡Hola, Bob!", "¡Hola, Charlie!", "¡Hola, David!", ...
2. You also don't have to worry about the names themselves changing into a translated form of their name: (i.e. "¡Hola, Alicia!", "¡Hola, Roberto!", ...).

As you can see, the `<Var>` component should be used to wrap any contents that should remain the same regardless of locale.
This way, we avoid the need to create translations for every possible value of the dynamic content.


By wrapping private information in a `<Var>` component, you can ensure that the information is not sent to the General Translations API.

    **Exceptions**

    The exceptions to the statement above is (1) in the case of a nested `<T>` component used inside of a `<Var>` component (ie, the children of the nested `<T>` component will be translated)
    or (2) when data is passed intentionally to our API via some other means within a child of the `<Var>` component (i.e., a fetch call).
    However, this is not the intended use of the `<Var>` component nor the General Translations API and doing so can harm load times and performance.
