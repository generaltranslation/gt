title: <T> Wrapping Behavior
description: Specific behavior of how the CLI tool wraps the `<T>` component
---

## Overview

This page describes the exact behavior of how the CLI tool wraps the `<T>` component.

As a rule of thumb, the CLI will wrap the [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component around any static, meaningful content.
It will also wrap a [`<Var>`](/docs/next/api/components/var) component around any dynamic subcontent contained within a `<T>` component.

For example, the following will be wrapped in a `<T>` component:
```jsx
<div>Hello, world!</div> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><div>Hello, world!</div></T>
```

but the following will not:
```jsx
<div><img src="logo.png" /></div> -> <div><img src="logo.png" /></div>
```

The CLI tool will always ensure that the final output is valid JSX and correctly uses the `<T>` component.

In some cases, such as with [logical operators](#logical-operators), some human intervention could be useful to ensure better translations with more context.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why can't <T> components wrap dynamic content?">
    Since the `<T>` component is typically pre-translated and cached, it is important to ensure that the content is not changed at runtime.
    If dynamic content were allowed, every user could potentially see a different translation of the same content.

    If you would like to translate content that changes at runtime, you should use the [`<Tx>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='What is considered "static" content?'>
    Static content is content that cannot change at runtime.
    For example, the following is static:
    ```jsx
    <div>Hello, world!</div>
    ```
    but the following is dynamic:
    ```jsx
    <div>{name}</div>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='What is considered "meaningful" content?'>
    
Meaningful content is content that could feasibly be translated and has a different meaning in a different language.

For example, this is meaningful:
```jsx
<div>Hello, world!</div> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><div>Hello, world!</div></T>
```
while these are not:
```jsx
<div><img src="logo.png" /></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><div></div></div>
<div><CustomButton/></div>
```

Regardless of what language the content is viewed in, the results are always the same.

<Callout type="info">
  Symbols such as '!', '?', '.', and "@" are considered not-meaningful, since they typically have the same meaning across languages and 
  translate to the same symbol.
  
  The regex used to determine if content is meaningful is:
  ```/[\p{L}\p{N}]/u;```

### JSX expressions

The CLI will automatically wrap expressions `{...}` in [`<Var>`](/docs/next/api/components/var) components.
This is because expressions are typically dynamic. 

```jsx
<div>Hello, {name}</div> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><div>Hello, <Var>{name}</Var></div></T>
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Content contained within a `<Var>` component will not be translated. 
  
  If you would like to translate dynamic content, you should use the [`<Tx>`](/docs/next/api/components/t) component instead.
</Callout>

### Static content in JSX expressions

The exception to the expression-wrapping rule is when the expression contains static content.

For example, the following will not be wrapped in a `<Var>` component:
```jsx
<p>{"Hello," + " World!"}</p> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><p>{"Hello," + " World!"}</p></T>
```


### Template literals in JSX expressions

The CLI will wrap template literals containing quasis (`${}`) in a [`<Var>`](/docs/next/api/components/var) component, since they can be dynamic.
```jsx
<p>{`${temp}`}</p> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><p><Var>{`${temp}`}</Var></p></T>
```

### Logical operators

JSX expressions containing logical operators such as `&&`, `||`, and `?` 
will be wrapped in a [`<Var>`](/docs/next/api/components/var) component,
if a `<T>` component is necessary at the top level. (i.e. if there is other meaningful content outside of the expression)

<Tabs items={["Before", "After"]}>
  <Tab value="Before">
    ```jsx
    <div>Hello, {name && {name}} World!</div>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="After">
    ```jsx
    <T id="SOME_ID">
      <div>Hello, <Var>{name && {name}}</Var> World!</div>
    </T>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Within the expression, the CLI will treat elements as if they are completely independent of the rest of the expression.

This means that they will be wrapped in their own `<T>` components (to ensure all content is translatable)

<Tabs items={["Before", "After"]}>
  <Tab value="Before">
    ```jsx
    <div>{name ? <>Hello, </> : <>Goodbye, </>}</div>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="After">
    ```jsx
    <T id="SOME_ID">
      <div>
        <Var>
          {name ? <T id="HELLO"><>Hello, </></T> : <T id="GOODBYE"><>Goodbye, </></T>}
        </Var> World!
      </div>
    </T>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Callout type="warn">
  In cases such as these, you should be using a [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch) or [`<Plural>`](/docs/next/api/components/plural) component instead.

  The CLI tool currently does not automatically use these components in a `<T>` component, so you will need to change the code manually.

  The previous example should be rewritten as:
  ```jsx
  <T id="SOME_ID">
    <div>
      <Branch branch={name == null}
        true={<>Hello, </>}
        false={<>Goodbye, </>}
      />
      World!
    </div>
  </T>
  ```
