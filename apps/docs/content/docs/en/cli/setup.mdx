title: React Setup
description: Integrates gt-next or gt-react with your project.
---
## Usage

```bash
npx gtx-cli setup
```

## Overview

The `gtx-cli setup` command automatically sets up your project for translation with `gt-next` or `gt-react`.
It does this by parsing your project's file tree and using babel to wrap the `<T>` component around static content.
Any dynamic content will be automatically wrapped with `<Var>` components.

This command is run as part of the `init` setup wizard. Additionally, this command can be ran independently via `npx gtx-cli setup`.

This command should be ran **once**, when you are first internationalizing your project.
On subsequent changes, you should use the `scan` command to update your project.

See the [scan](/docs/cli/scan) command for more details.


```jsx title="src/app/Home.js"
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next';  // [!code highlight]

export default function Home({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <T id="app.home.0">
        {/* [!code highlight] */}
        Hello, World! My name is <Var>{ user.name }</Var>
      </T>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If your project is using the Next.js App Router, the setup command will add a `<GTProvider>` component within the appropriate `layout.jsx` file.

## Behavior

### Configuration file

When running the CLI tool for the first time, it will attempt to create a `gt.config.json` file in the root of your project.
This file contains metadata about your project that is used to translate your content.

Read more about the `gt.config.json` file [here](/docs/cli/reference/config).

### The `id` prop

The setup command gives the option of automatically generating unique IDs for your `<T>` components.
This is useful for projects that use a lot of `<T>` components and want to avoid manually having to assign each one a unique ID.

This `id` is useful for referencing specific translations in the translation editor and in the console.

### `<T>` injection behavior

#### Basic case

The CLI will wrap JSX elements at the highest possible level.
This means that it will wrap the entire component in a `<T>` component if it is not already wrapped.

```jsx
<div>Hello, World!</div> -> <T id="SOME_ID"><div>Hello, World!</div></T>
```

See the [reference](/docs/cli/reference/wrapping) for more details on how the `<T>` component is wrapped.

### `<GTProvider>` behavior

For the Next.js App Router, the setup command will automatically wrap the `<T>` component in a `<GTProvider>` component within the appropriate `layout.jsx` file.

Additionally, it will setup the `withGTConfig` Next.js plugin in the `next.config.js` file for you.

### Auto-formatting

The setup command will automatically format the changes it makes to your codebase with Prettier, Biome, or ESLint depending on your project's configuration.
