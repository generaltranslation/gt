description: How to automatically translate your project using the General Translation CLI tool
---

```bash
npx gtx-cli@latest
```

## Overview

The General Translation CLI tool (`gtx-cli`) allows you to automatically translate your project into any of the [supported languages](/docs/platform/locale-strings#supported-locales).

It provides first-class support for [`gt-next`](/docs/react) and [`gt-react`](/docs/react) with your project, allowing you to scan your project for translatable content, translate your project, and generate translation data JSON files.

The CLI tool can also be used to generate translations for third-party i18n libraries like [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/) or [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

Lastly, the CLI tool can be used to translate JSON, Markdown, MDX, JS, and TS files.

<Callout type="warn">
  A Production API key is required for the `translate` command. Get one for free at [generaltranslation.com](https://generaltranslation.com)!

There are two main commands you should be aware of: `init` and `translate`.

 * [The `init` command](/docs/cli/init) is used to setup your project. It provides a step by step 
  wizard that will configure your project for internationalization, including:
  - Setting up plugins and React providers
  - Generating API keys
  - Configuring your project's locales and files structure
 * [The `translate` command](/docs/cli/translate) is meant to be added to your CI/CD pipeline.
   It is used to scan your project for content to be translated.
   The content is then uploaded to a CDN or added to your app bundle to be used at runtime.

## Getting Started

Depending on what i18n library your project is using, please follow one of the following tutorials:

* [gt-next](/docs/cli/formats/gt)
* [gt-react](/docs/cli/formats/gt)
* [next-intl](/docs/cli/formats/next-intl-quickstart)
* [i18next](/docs/cli/formats/i18next-quickstart)
* [JSON](/docs/cli/formats/json)
* [Markdown](/docs/cli/formats/mdx)
