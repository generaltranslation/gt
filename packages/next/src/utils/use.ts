// Original comments included for reference:

// @ts-expect-error -- Ooof, Next.js doesn't make this easy.
// `use` is only available in React 19 canary, but we can
// use it in Next.js already as Next.js "vendors" a fixed
// version of React. However, if we'd simply put `use` in
// ESM code, then the build doesn't work since React does
// not export `use` officially. Therefore, we have to use
// something that is not statically analyzable. Once React
// 19 is out, we can remove this in the next major version.
