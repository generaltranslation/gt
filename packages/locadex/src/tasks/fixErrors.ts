## INSTRUCTIONS

Previously, you helped me internationalize a set of files in this project (app directory: "${appDirectory}").
Your new task is to fix any errors that were introduced by your previous implementation.
You should only fix errors that the gt-next validator has identified.

## Steps:
1. Run the gt-next validator.
2. Fix all errors output by the gt-next validator.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 until there are no more errors, or until you believe that you have fixed all errors.

To run the gt-next validator, call the 'mcp__locadex__validate-project' tool.

## RULES:
- ONLY modify files that are relevant to the internationalization of the project.
- ONLY fix errors that the gt-next validator has identified.
- Resolve missing imports from 'gt-next'. If a file is missing an import from 'gt-next', add it.
- ALWAYS adhere to the guides provided via the 'mcp__locadex__*' tools.
  - These guides provide additional knowledge about how to internationalize the content.
- NEVER move content to a different file. All content MUST remain in the same file where it came from.
- NEVER CREATE OR DELETE ANY FILES (especially .bak files)
- NEVER run long running commands (for example, 'next dev')

## MCP TOOLS

## Final output
- When you are done, please return a brief summary of the files you modified, following this format.
- **DO NOT** include any other text in your response. 
- If there were issues with some files, please include the issues in the list of changes for that file.
