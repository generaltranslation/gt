# @generaltranslation/icu

## 0.2.0-samsara.1

### Minor Changes

- 726168a: Move the ICU string parser to `@generaltranslation/icu/parser`. The root entry no longer exports `parse`, `formatMessage`, `printAST`, the syntax-tree types, `TYPE`, or `SKELETON_TYPE`; import them from `@generaltranslation/icu/parser` instead. `formatMessage` now parses to a message tree and formats it exactly like `formatMessageTree`, with the same types. This changes how plain values render in ICU strings, including through `formatMessage` in `@generaltranslation/format` and `generaltranslation` and the string API built on them: they format like a template literal, so `true` is `'true'`, `false` is `'false'`, and bigints and Dates in a plain `{value}` are text (`null` and `undefined` stay empty). Previously intl-messageformat's rules kept `true`, bigints and Dates as parts, which the string API joined with commas, as in `'before ,true, after'`.

  The root entry now ships without the parser and works with message trees, a compact JSON form of a message where text is a string, `#` is `0`, and each placeholder is a tuple such as `['count', 'plural', { one: [0, ' file'], other: [0, ' files'] }]`. It adds `formatMessageTree` for formatting them (plain values, Dates included, format as text, like a template literal, so the result is typed `string` unless a value is rich, such as a React element or a tag formatter's result), and `validateMessageTree` and `isMessageTree` for checking untrusted trees against the `MessageTree` type. The new `@generaltranslation/icu/internal` entry, shared by General Translation packages and not a public API, holds `buildMessageTree` for building canonical trees from template parts (template text is always literal, including `#`; a `pound` hole is the plural count) and `findConflictingFormat` for finding a variable with two formats ICU spells the same way, which a translation cannot tell apart. The new `@generaltranslation/icu/convert` entry converts ICU strings to message trees with `icuToMessageTree` and prints trees as ICU with `messageTreeToIcu`; printing writes Intl options as an ICU skeleton such as `::currency/USD` (or the named `percent` style) that `icuToMessageTree` reads back as the same format, so every ICU string it reads prints back, leaves out tree-only options with no ICU spelling (such as `timeZone`), and `icuToMessageTree(icu, { source })` restores those from the tree the string was printed from.
