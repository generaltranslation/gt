# gt-next Middleware E2E Tests

End-to-end tests and benchmarks for the gt-next middleware system. Uses a real Next.js app with Playwright to validate locale routing, cookie state machine, and client-server sync across multiple configuration variants.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test:e2e:install   # Install Playwright browsers
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All E2E variants (automated: pack gt-next → build per variant → test → restore)
pnpm test:e2e

# All benchmarks (unit + e2e)
pnpm bench

# Unit benchmarks only (vitest bench, no server needed)
pnpm bench:unit

# E2E performance benchmarks only (Playwright, needs pack + build)
pnpm bench:e2e
```

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm bench   # Runs all middleware benchmarks via turbo
```

## Config Variants

The middleware reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CASE` at build time. Each variant gets its own spec file and a separate `next build` + `next start` cycle.

| Variant | Middleware Config | Tests |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| `main` | `prefixDefaultLocale: false` | 6 |
| `prefix-default` | `prefixDefaultLocale: true` | 5 |
| `path-config` | Localized paths for `/about` | 5 |
| `no-routing` | `localeRouting: false` | 5 |

## pnpm pack

This app requires `pnpm pack` to install gt-next as a tarball rather than a workspace link. The Next.js edge runtime bundler resolves `next/server` differently for symlinked packages, causing runtime errors in the middleware bundle. Both `runPlaywright.mjs` and `runBenchE2E.mjs` handle this automatically — pack, swap, test, restore.
