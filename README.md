## Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;Translate entire React components, not just strings

- Just wrap your content in a `<T>` component!
- No need for complex refactoring or managing JSON files.

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T>
  );
}
```

### üîé&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature parity with existing libraries

- GT libraries also support the same features as existing libraries like `next-intl` and `react-i18next`.
- Features such as dictionaries, plurals, currencies, and automatic routing are all supported.

### üîß&nbsp;&nbsp;Developer-friendly

- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes.
- All GT libraries are open-source and work standalone.
  - You can use your own translation provider or use our free AI-powered translation service.
- No more managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!

### üß†&nbsp;&nbsp;Free, context-aware AI translation service

- Translation hot reload in development
- Libraries integrate natively with the translation platform.
- Translations are generated for your app in seconds.
- HTML content is re-arranged and customized according to the language.
